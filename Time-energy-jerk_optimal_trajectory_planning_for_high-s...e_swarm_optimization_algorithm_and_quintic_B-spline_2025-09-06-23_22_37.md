This paper presents a technique for multi-node trajectory planning for high-speed parallel manipulators that optimizes the execution time, energy consumption and jerk (the time derivative of the acceleration of the manipulator joints) to improve working efficiency, decrease energy consumption, dampen vibration and ensure mechanism protection. Initially, an improved quintic B-spline interpolation model is proposed, incorporating additional jerk boundary constraints to dampen residual vibrations at the start and end of the trajectory. Subsequently, the time-energy-jerk optimization model is formulated, with the maximum angular velocity, acceleration, and jerk serving as constraints. The normalized parameter of the B-spline curve is considered to divide the whole model into two submodels. In the first submodel, the satisfaction function is proposed to convert energy and jerk indices into one comprehensive objective for optimization with the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. Time parameters are to be decided as decision variables, regardless of kinematic constraints and execution time. In the second submodel, the optimal time parameters obtained in the first submodel are used as input arguments, and the optimal execution time is determined with respect to the kinematic constraints. The simulation results on a planar parallel manipulator show that the proposed method achieves an efficient trajectory, which is energy-saving and possesses reduced vibration. Application of the comprehensive trajectory generated by the proposed method, rather than the classical method, enhances the maximum productivity of the fast pick-and-place operation to 155 picks per minute from 97 picks/min. This improvement is accomplished by using less energy and reducing vibration.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, the rapid advancement of industrial automation has led to the widespread adoption of robotic systems in both production systems and everyday life. With the advent of intelligent manufacturing, robotic manipulators are becoming increasingly important in ensuring time optimization and increasing work potential through their controlled operation in various tasks and stages, including production efficiency, error-free assembly accuracy, and vibration-free and barrier-free transportation of materials. Robotic manipulators consisting of a collection of rigid arms that are connected through rotating or prismatic joints can be programmed and self-controlled in two or more axes, allowing them to move objects from one point to another with ease (Ekrem and Aksoy, 2023).

In the field of robotic manipulators, a fundamental issue pertains to trajectory planning. This refers to the process of determining a temporal motion law that follows a specified geometric path and satisfies certain trajectory properties. The goal of trajectory planning is to generate reference inputs for the manipulator's control system, which will enable the execution of the motion. The inputs to the trajectory planning algorithm consist of the geometric path, kinematic and dynamic constraints, while the output is the trajectory of the joints or the end effector expressed as a sequence of position, velocity, and acceleration values over time (Sahu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).

In multi-point trajectory generation (Wu et al., 2023), the geometric path is typically defined as a set of via-points (the points the trajectory must pass through, representing position and orientation of the reference frame linked to the end effector) in the operating space of the manipulator's end effector (Lin et al., 1983) because it allows for a more natural description of the task to be completed. However, trajectory planning is generally performed in the joint space of the manipulator, which requires a kinematic inversion of the provided via-points. Interpolating functions are then used to generate joint trajectories that adhere to the prescribed kinematic and dynamic constraints.

There are many trajectories that can pass through all the via-points given by the task and satisfy the constraints at the same time. It is necessary to select a trajectory with excellent performance that meet our needs. The common requirements of trajectories include improving efficiency (Abu-Dakka et al., 2017), saving energy (Li et al., 2023), reducing the vibration (Bilal et al., 2023) of the end effector to meet work demands, reducing joint vibration to protect the mechanism, and improving tracking accuracy (Gasparetto et al., 2015). Applying the following important optimization criteria, some of the aforementioned requirements can be realized.

(1) minimum execution time for high efficiency (Huang et al., 2018),

(2) minimum jerk (the time derivative of the acceleration of the manipulator joints) (Dong et al., 2015),

(3) minimum energy consumption (Bjorkenstam et al., 2013),

(4) hybrid criteria (Agahi and Notash, 2010; Shinde and Pawar, 2023; Wang et al., 2022).

The kinematic constraints are the maximum absolute values of the joint velocity, acceleration and jerk, and the trajectory generated is within the working space of the manipulator.

Previous literature (Constantinescu and Croft, 2000) limits the actuator jerks (the variation rates of the joint torques) and thus the accuracy in trajectory following increases and high frequency vibration is dampened so that the manipulator structure is protected. However, this technique requires a lot of computations. An indirect technique to get the same results is to impose the limits on the jerk and this method has been widely used due to its low calculation and simplicity. The motion laws must conform to a priori constraints on the maximum of the generalized joint torques and must avoid exciting any mechanical resonance mode. This objective can be achieved by producing smooth trajectories with continuous joint accelerations, thereby keeping the absolute value of the jerk bounded. Limiting the jerk is critical because high values of jerk can lead to the worn-out robot structure and significantly excite its resonance frequencies. Vibration resulting from non-smooth trajectories can damage the robot actuators and cause significant errors. Additionally, trajectories with lower jerk can be executed more quickly and accurately (Gasparetto and Zanotto, 2007).

The use of energetic criteria in robot trajectory planning yields smoother trajectories, making them easier to track and reducing stress on the actuators and manipulator structure. Additionally, energy conservation is a desirable factor in many applications. Many studies on minimum energy consumption analyze and establish energy indicators from the perspective of dynamics, which involves the calculation of actuator torques (Abe, 2013; Gregory et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2014). In recent years, similar to the case of jerk, some articles have used the kinematic index of the sum of the square root of the time integral of the squared joint accelerations as the objective function to indirectly minimize energy consumption (Liu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). The kinematic method has smaller computational complexity and is more convenient, so this article uses the kinematic energy consumption index.

When generating trajectories with interpolation curves, certain parameters must be determined, and computing the optimal parameters is a continuous optimization problem. For such problems, intelligent algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) (Seddaoui and Saaj, 2021; Yang et al., 2021), particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (Cheng et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2019; Ramabalan et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021), simulated annealing (SA) algorithm (Shi et al., 2023), ant colony algorithm (Baghli et al., 2017) and so on can produce solutions. J. Kennedy originally proposed the PSO algorithm as a simulation of flocking birds' social behavior (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995). The algorithm's ease of implementation and low computational requirements, including memory and CPU speed, make it an efficient solution for many continuous problems. PSO can also overcome specific obstacles that plague GA algorithms (Angeline, 1998).

The global search capability of the original PSO was improved through the introduction of quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) (Sun et al., 2004a, 2004b, 2005). QPSO features a distinct iterative equation from that of PSO, resulting in improved global convergence (Sun et al., 2011). QPSO also requires fewer parameters than PSO to adjust and does not depend on velocity vectors, making it easier to implement.

In QPSO algorithm, the magnitude of fitness function only serves to rank the solutions, while the fitness difference size between two solutions is insignificant. However, this is not true for most heuristic algorithms. For example, in traditional SA algorithms, an initial temperature is set to map the objective function value to a suitable size as the fitness function. The simple GA uses the roulette wheel selection to determine the probability based on positive fitness function values, and the objective function often needs to be mapped to a positive fitness function value through a positivization function (i.e., a monotonically increasing function that converts negative inputs to non-negative outputs). The selection of a positivization function is based on the characteristics of the objective function, and the required positivization function may vary with different magnitudes of objective functions. In addition, the ordinal fitness in QPSO algorithm not only eliminates the impact of the objective function scale on the algorithm performance but also reduces the number of parameters.

The two main methods to solve multi-objective optimization problems are weighted approaches (Gasparetto and Zanotto, 2008; Shiller, 1996) and Pareto-based approaches (Serralheiro et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Zitzler, 1999). Generally, the Pareto-based approaches offer a trade-off curve among the evaluation objectives and provide diverse solutions, which have been found to be more acceptable than non-Pareto-based approaches. However, the Pareto-based method requires significant calculation. The weighted method is relatively simple in that it converts multiple objectives into a single objective using weight coefficients. However, many studies determine weights empirically rather than analytically because the differing orders of magnitude of objectives often complicates selecting suitable weight values.

This paper investigates trajectory planning of a 2 degrees of freedom (2-DOF) parallel manipulator in a pick-and-place scenario (Barbazza et al., 2017). In contrast to serial manipulators, parallel manipulators have higher operating speeds. Such high-speed motion in assembly, picking, packaging, handling, and other applications commonly results in residual vibration of the joints at start and end moments, so two additional jerk boundary constraints are considered to dampen the residual vibration.

The study illustrates the construction of a time-energy-jerk optimization model by interpolating the \( {\mathrm{C}}^{4} \) continuous smooth trajectory with quintic B-spline curve (Piegl and Tiller, 1995). The satisfaction function is proposed to normalize the objectives, then the weighted method can analytically determine the appropriate coefficients. The multi-objective model is divided into two single-objective models, which are then solved using the QPSO algorithm. This enhances the efficiency of the high-speed system, reduces energy consumption, and improves its stability. By the way, despite focusing on the 2-DOF parallel manipulator, the suggested trajectory planning method may be applicable to other manipulators.

### 1.1. Related works

Recent advancements in trajectory planning are shown below. An article (Liu et al., 2020) proposed a 4-3-3-4 degree piecewise polynomial interpolation for the purpose of time-optimal trajectory planning of a Delta parallel manipulator to accomplish a point-to-point "door" type handling operation using an improved PSO algorithm (Fan et al., 2023). produced a Cartesian-based time optimal trajectory that incorporates jerk constraints through iterative optimization. Also (Zhang et al., 2018), enhanced the crossover and mutation operators of the GA by using a cosine formula to optimize the quintic polynomial-based time optimal trajectory. Additionally (Su et al., 2018), proposed a time-optimal trajectory planning method which employs quintic Pythagorean-Hodograph curves to enable smooth and stable high-speed operation of the Delta parallel robot. In another study (Li et al., 2023), a time-jerk optimal trajectory was generated for a high-speed robot using a fifth-order B-spline. The weighted method was applied to transform the problem's dual objectives into a single objective, and an optimization problem was solved via the improved chicken swarm algorithm. In the same vein, cubic spline interpolation was utilized in (Wang et al., 2020) to create a time-jerk optimal trajectory for a six-axis industrial robot using an improved whale optimization algorithm. The two objectives are transformed into a single objective with the weight coefficients, which are determined by experiments. Finally, multi-objective optimization is achieved through the use of quintic NURBS curves and the NSGA-II algorithm to obtain a time-energy-jerk optimal trajectory in the works of (Shi et al., 2016, 2018; Wu et al., 2021).

Although there have been numerous advancements in the field of trajectory planning, the following deficiencies still exist.

(1) The interpolation model is designed for specific application scenarios, making it suitable for only limited via-points, leading to limited extensibility (Liu et al., 2020; Su et al., 2018).

(2) The optimization process does not incorporate the reduction of jerk to minimize vibration in high-speed parallel manipulators (Liu et al., 2020; Su et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018).

(3) Challenged by differing orders of magnitude of objectives, there are no universal ways to determine weight coefficients that help transform various objectives into a single comprehensive objective (Shiller, 1996).

(4) The jerk boundary constraints are not considered, thus leading to residual vibration when the trajectory planning technique is implemented for high-speed parallel manipulators (Li et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2018, 2016; Wang et al., 2020).

(5) Limited research has been conducted on the consideration of execution time, energy consumption, and jerk simultaneously (Fan et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2020; Su et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018).

### 1.2. Motivations and contributions

The majority of existing literature concentrates on optimizing only the one part of these three important objectives (execution time, energy consumption, jerk) mentioned before while neglecting the comprehensive optimization of them. In addition, jerk boundary constraints are rarely considered to dampen residual vibration in high-speed parallel manipulators, due to the inadequate number of via-points utilized to establish the quintic B-spline (or NURBS) interpolation model, making it challenging to produce sufficient knots while trying to adhere to the jerk boundary constraints. The parameter of the B-spline (or NURBS) curve is normalized so that the execution time as well as the velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints can be considered after the energy objective and the jerk objective achieve their comprehensive optimization. This simplified approach to address multi-objective optimization problems is significant while devising time-energy optimal or time-jerk optimal trajectories since it enables comprehensive objective optimization to be individually tackled as two single-objective optimization problems. Furthermore, finding appropriate weight coefficients to convert a multi-objective problem to a single-objective one is challenging because the various objectives have differing orders of magnitude.

This paper contributes to the field of optimal trajectory generation in various ways based on the aforementioned discussion.

1. The quintic B-spline-based trajectory generation approach is enhanced by including two virtual via-points that enable the incorporation of jerk boundary constraints into the model, resulting in reduced residual vibration.

2. A time-energy-jerk optimization model is created, which is divided into two submodels considering the normalized parameter of the B-spline. The energy-jerk comprehensive optimization is solved without kinematic constraints. Then, execution time is optimized with the limitation on the absolute joint velocity, acceleration, and jerk.

3. The satisfaction function is proposed to convert the multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective model, accounting for the challenges caused by differing orders of magnitude of objectives. The QPSO algorithm is an apt choice for the whole model.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The kinematics analysis of the manipulator is presented in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, a pick-and-place working scenario is depicted, and the trajectory is generated through the quintic B-spline curve. In Section 4, we construct a time-energy-jerk optimization model. Next, in Section 5, we explain the process of solving the entire model, including the introduction of the QPSO algorithm, the satisfaction function, which converts various objectives into a single objective, and the derivation of the optimal execution time. In Section 6, we provide a detailed mathematical process for the proposed method, followed by a robustness analysis. Additionally, we compare the optimized results with those obtained from other multi-objective optimization algorithms. Conclusion and future research of this study are presented in Section 7.

### 1.3. Model assumptions

To increase the rigor of this paper, it is necessary to make certain assumptions.

1. It is assumed that the load is considerably lighter than the carrying capacity of the manipulator. This assumption disregards the impact of the load on the manipulator's trajectory performance, thereby bringing the theoretical results closer to reality.

2. Assuming that vibration can be measured by absolute jerk, there is a positive correlation between the two. It is common practice to optimize jerk in order to reduce vibrations, as high jerk values often result in significant vibrations. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, due to the location of the system resonant frequency, in some cases, the trajectories with limited jerk may even lead to more intense vibration relative to the trajectories with discontinuous acceleration. Therefore, it is essential to assume that there is a positive correlation between vibration and absolute jerk, as this facilitates further discussions. However, in practical applications, it is also necessary to consider other factors comprehensively, such as the dynamic performance of the robotic arm, the robustness of the control system, and the stability of the mechanical structure. This will enable a more thorough analysis of whether the calculated trajectory will exhibit resonance behavior.

## 2. Kinematics analysis of the 2 degrees of freedom manipulator

Fig. 1 shows a 3D model of the 2-DOF parallel manipulator under consideration. The manipulator is composed of a base, a movable platform, and two identical kinematic chains. Driven independently by two active proximal links, the manipulator provides a movable platform with a 2-DOF translational motion capability (Huang et al., 2013).

The motions of the active and passive proximal links are identical, as are those of the distal links within the parallelograms, allowing the kinematic model of the manipulator to be simplified to the 5R planar linkage shown in Fig. 2.

\( {\theta }_{1} \) and \( {\theta }_{2} \) are the joint angles shown in Fig. 2 and each of them is negative when the master arm is below the X-axis and positive when the master arm is above the X-axis. \( {l}_{1} \) and \( {l}_{2} \) denote the length of the master arm and the slave arm respectively, and the end effector is considered a mass point \( \widehat{\mathbf{r}} = \left( {\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}\right) \) .

The angular displacements of the joints can be expressed as

\[{\theta }_{i} = 2\arctan \left( \frac{-{E}_{i} \pm  \sqrt{{E}_{i}^{2} + {F}_{i}^{2} - {G}_{i}^{2}}}{{G}_{i} - {F}_{i}}\right) ,i = 1,2 \tag{1}\]

Note that only one of the positive and negative signs in " \( \pm \) " will be retained in Eq. (1)(3), while the other will be discarded. In this study, we determine which sign to preserve by creating a simulation model.

## 3. Trajectory generation

### 3.1. Description of the operating space path

Fig. 3 shows a typical "door" type geometric path for pick-and-place operations in Fig. 4. The task of the mobile end effector of the manipulator is carried out through two processes, namely, grabbing and placing. In each grabbing movement process, the manipulator acts the ascending segment \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{0}{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{2} \) ,the horizontal segment \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{3}{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{4} \) ,and the descending segments \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{5}{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{7} \) in turn; in each placing movement process, the manipulator acts the ascending segment \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{7}{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{5} \) ,the horizontal segment \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{4}{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{3} \) ,and the descending segments \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{2}{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{0} \) in turn. In a standard "door" type path, \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{2},{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{3},{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{4},{\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{5} \) are at the same height to avoid making quick turns at corners,usually setting \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{2} \) and \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{5} \) at a lower height.

The problem is treated as a multi-node trajectory planning problem, namely, the points shown in Fig. 3 are all the via-points though in the original task the points except the start and the end ones are unnecessary to go through. For the geometric path depicted by dashed line segments, the via-points given may include \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{1} \) and \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{6}\left( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{1}\right. \) and \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{6} \) correspond to the midpoints of their respective line segments) or exclude them. Incorporating a midpoint as an additional via-point, when employing B-spline curve interpolation, allows for the division of a lengthy line segment into two shorter ones, resulting in a more linear shape. Nonetheless, this addition can intensify computational complexity and potentially compromise the trajectory's performance.

### 3.2. Improved quintic B-spline interpolation in joint space

In some other literature, mathematical trajectory planning models are proposed for specific application scenarios. For instance, in the study by (Liu et al., 2020), they developed the 4-3-4 piecewise polynomial interpolation model, but it can only be used for 5 via-points leading to limited extensibility. Despite the clear definition of the application situation in Section 3.1, a trajectory planning model that can be universally applied to any number of via-points is introduced in this paper. The improved quintic B-spline interpolation model with additional jerk boundary constraints is introduced to mitigate residual vibration at start and end moments.

#### 3.2.1. Description of the B-spline

A B-spline curve with degree \( p \) is formulated as

\[\mathbf{C}\left( u\right)  = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 0}}^{r}{N}_{i,p}\left( u\right) {\mathbf{P}}_{i},u \in  \left\lbrack  {0,1}\right\rbrack   \tag{5}\]

where, \( {\mathbf{P}}_{i} \) denotes a control point with index \( i,p \) denotes the degree of \( \mathrm{B} \) - spline basis function \( {N}_{i,p}\left( u\right) \) ,and \( r + 1 \) denotes the total number of control points. \( {N}_{i,p}\left( u\right) \) is defined by deBoor-Cox recursion equation over a non-uniform knot vector \( U \) ,which is a nonnegative nondecreasing sequence of real numbers with the length of \( r + p + 2 \) :

\[U = \left\{  {\underset{p + 1}{\underbrace{0,0,\ldots ,0}},{u}_{p + 1},{u}_{p + 2},\ldots ,{u}_{r},\underset{p + 1}{\underbrace{1,1,\ldots ,1}}}\right\}   \tag{6}\]

The form of the non-uniform knot vector \( U \) shown in Eq. (6) can ensure that the curve passes through the start control point and the end control point. deBoor-Cox recursion equation (Boor, 1972) is as follows:

\[\left\{  \begin{matrix} {N}_{i,0}\left( u\right)  = \left\{  \begin{matrix} 1,{u}_{i} \leq  u < {u}_{i + 1} \\  0,\text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right. \\  {N}_{i,p}\left( u\right)  = \frac{u - {u}_{i}}{{u}_{i + p} - {u}_{i}}{N}_{i,p - 1}\left( u\right)  + \frac{{u}_{i + p + 1} - u}{{u}_{i + p + 1} - {u}_{i + 1}}{N}_{i + 1,p - 1}\left( u\right) \\  \text{ define }\frac{0}{0} = 0 \end{matrix}\right.  \tag{7}\]

The \( k \) th derivative of the curve is given by

\[{\mathbf{C}}^{\left( k\right) }\left( u\right)  = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 0}}^{{r - k}}{N}_{i,p - k}\left( u\right) {\mathbf{P}}_{i}^{\left( k\right) } \tag{8}\]

where,

\[{\mathbf{P}}_{i}^{\left( k\right) } = \left\{  \begin{matrix} {\mathbf{P}}_{i},k = 0 \\  \frac{p - k + 1}{{u}_{i + p + 1} - {u}_{i + k}}\left( {{\mathbf{P}}_{i + 1}^{\left( k - 1\right) } - {\mathbf{P}}_{i}^{\left( k - 1\right) }}\right) ,k > 0 \end{matrix}\right.  \tag{9}\]

#### 3.2.2. Construction of the linear system of equations of the interpolation problem

To limit jerk, \( \mathbf{C}\left( u\right) \) is set to be \( {\mathrm{C}}^{4} \) continuous,and due to the multiplicity 1 of each interior knot,it can be deduced that \( p \geq  5 \) . Considering the instability of the higher order curve, \( p = 5 \) is taken in this paper,and thus the curve is called quintic \( B \) -spline.

Let the velocity, the acceleration, and the jerk be 0 at start and end moments, and thus the boundary constraint equations can be formulated as

\[\left\{  \begin{array}{l} {\mathbf{C}}^{\left( k\right) }\left( 0\right)  = \mathbf{0},k = 1,2,3 \\  {\mathbf{C}}^{\left( k\right) }\left( 1\right)  = \mathbf{0},k = 1,2,3 \end{array}\right.  \tag{10}\]

Let \( \left\{  {{\mathbf{Q}}_{k},k = 0,1,2,\ldots ,n}\right\} \) be the via-points in the joint space mapped from the via-points \( {\widehat{\mathbf{Q}}}_{k} \) in the operating space given by the task. And the time parameter sequence \( \left\{  {{\bar{u}}_{k} \in  \left\lbrack  {0,1}\right\rbrack  ,k = 0,1,2,\ldots ,n}\right\} \) consisting of time parameter \( {\bar{u}}_{k} \) is a nonnegative nondecreasing sequence that corresponds to these via-points in turn. When \( u = {\bar{u}}_{k} \) ,the trajectory passes through the via-point \( {\mathbf{Q}}_{k} \) ,and the constraint equations can be formulated as

\[\mathbf{C}\left( {\bar{u}}_{k}\right)  = {\mathbf{Q}}_{k},k = 0,1,2,\ldots ,n \tag{11}\]

The number of constraint equations is \( n + 7 \) and thus \( r = n + 6 \) . From Eq. (5,10,11),the equivalent matrix form can be obtained as follows:

\[\left\{  \begin{matrix} \left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {N}_{0,p}\left( {\bar{u}}_{k}\right) & {N}_{1,p}\left( {\bar{u}}_{k}\right) & \ldots & {N}_{r,p}\left( {\bar{u}}_{k}\right)  \end{array}\right\rbrack  {\left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {\mathbf{P}}_{0} & {\mathbf{P}}_{1} & \ldots & {\mathbf{P}}_{r} \end{array}\right\rbrack  }^{\mathrm{T}} = {\mathbf{Q}}_{k}, \\  k = 0,1,2,\ldots n \\  \left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {N}_{0,p}^{\left( k\right) }\left( 1\right) & {N}_{1,p}^{\left( k\right) }\left( 1\right) & \ldots & {N}_{r,p}^{\left( k\right) }\left( 1\right)  \end{array}\right\rbrack  {\left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {\mathbf{P}}_{0} & {\mathbf{P}}_{1} & \ldots & {\mathbf{P}}_{r} \end{array}\right\rbrack  }^{\mathrm{T}} = \mathbf{0}, \\  k = 1,2,3 \\  \left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {N}_{0,p}^{\left( k\right) }\left( 0\right) & {N}_{1,p}^{\left( k\right) }\left( 0\right) & \ldots & {N}_{r,p}^{\left( k\right) }\left( 0\right)  \end{array}\right\rbrack  {\left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {\mathbf{P}}_{0} & {\mathbf{P}}_{1} & \ldots & {\mathbf{P}}_{r} \end{array}\right\rbrack  }^{\mathrm{T}} = \mathbf{0}, \\  k = 1,2,3 \end{matrix}\right.  \tag{12}\]

Let \( Y = {\left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {\mathbf{P}}_{0} & {\mathbf{P}}_{1} & \ldots & {\mathbf{P}}_{n + 6} \end{array}\right\rbrack  }^{\mathrm{T}},b = {\left\lbrack  \begin{array}{lllllllll} {\mathbf{Q}}_{0} & {\mathbf{Q}}_{1} & \ldots & {\mathbf{Q}}_{n} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} \end{array}\right\rbrack  }^{\mathrm{T}} \) , then have

\[{AY} = b \tag{13}\]

where,

\[{A}_{\left( {n + 7}\right)  \times  \left( {n + 7}\right) } = \left\lbrack  \begin{matrix} {\mathbf{\alpha }}_{0} \\  {\mathbf{\alpha }}_{1} \\  \vdots \\  {\mathbf{\alpha }}_{n + 6} \end{matrix}\right\rbrack   \tag{14}\]

\[{\mathbf{\alpha }}_{k} = \left\{  \begin{matrix} \left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {N}_{0,p}\left( {\bar{u}}_{k}\right) & {N}_{1,p}\left( {\bar{u}}_{k}\right) & \ldots & {N}_{r,p}\left( {\bar{u}}_{k}\right)  \end{array}\right\rbrack  , \\  k = 0,1,\ldots ,n \\  \left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {N}_{0,p}^{\left( k - n\right) }\left( 0\right) & {N}_{1,p}^{\left( k - n\right) }\left( 0\right) & \ldots & {N}_{r,p}^{\left( k - n\right) }\left( 0\right) \\  k & k - n + 1,n + 2,n + 3 & &  \end{array}\right\rbrack  , \\  \left\lbrack  \begin{array}{llll} {N}_{0,p}^{\left( k - n - 3\right) }\left( 1\right) & {N}_{1,p}^{\left( k - n - 3\right) }\left( 1\right) & \ldots & {N}_{r,p}^{\left( k - n - 3\right) }\left( 1\right) \\  k & n + 4,n + 5,n + 6 & &  \end{array}\right\rbrack  , \end{matrix}\right.  \tag{15}\]

Now solving Eq. (13) and the unknown control points can be expressed as (assuming \( A \) is invertible)

<!-- Meanless: 5-->




<!-- Meanless: W. Chen et al. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107223-->

\[Y = {A}^{-1}b \tag{16}\]

Note that each element of \( Y \) and any via-point \( {\mathbf{Q}}_{k} \) are the same size,and consequently, it is necessary to construct the scalar linear system of equations for each dimension of the points when using a computer to solve the problem.

#### 3.2.3. Imagine virtual via-points to get enough knots

In previous literature, the 2 jerk boundary constraint equations are not taken into account so the number of interior knots is \( n - 1 \) ,which is equal to the number of interior time parameters. As a result, interior knots are directly generated by the interior time parameters (see Fig. 5).

Now there are \( r - p = n + 1 \) interior knots in the knot vector \( U \) ,and we have \( n - 1 \) interior time parameters. It is a good way to imagine that there are 2 additional virtual via-points, one between the first and the second existing via-points, and the other between the last and the penultimate ones.

The virtual via-points are not constants and they are actually the points on the B-spline curve. Allocating 2 additional virtual time parameters \( {\bar{u}}_{e1} \) and \( {\bar{u}}_{e2} \) for the virtual via-points,then the interior knots in \( U \) are

\[\left\{  {{\bar{u}}_{e1},{\bar{u}}_{1},{\bar{u}}_{2},\ldots ,{\bar{u}}_{n - 1},{\bar{u}}_{e2}}\right\}   \tag{17}\]

where, \( {\bar{u}}_{e1} = \frac{{\bar{u}}_{0} + {\bar{u}}_{1}}{2},{\bar{u}}_{e2} = \frac{{\bar{u}}_{n - 1} + {\bar{u}}_{n}}{2} \) .

The interpolation process is completed with the provision of all necessary time parameters. Each unique set of time parameters generates a distinct trajectory, thus necessitating the creation of a multi-objective optimization model in order to derive a time-energy-jerk optimal trajectory. Ultimately, this model must be solved in order to obtain the optimal time parameters.

## 4. Time-energy-jerk optimization model statements

The time-energy-jerk optimization model is mathematically formulated as

\[\text{Minimize}{Z}_{\text{time }} = T\]

\[\text{ Minimize }{Z}_{\text{energy }} = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{2}\sqrt{{\int }_{0}^{1}{a}_{u,i}^{2}\left( u\right) \mathrm{d}t}\]

\[\text{ Minimize }{Z}_{\text{jerk }} = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{2}\mathop{\max }\limits_{{u \in  \left\lbrack  {0,1}\right\rbrack  }}\left\{  \left| {{j}_{u,i}\left( u\right) }\right| \right\}   \tag{18}\]

\[\text{ s.t. }\left\{  \begin{array}{l} \left| {{v}_{t,i}\left( t\right) }\right|  \leq  {v}_{\max ,i},i = 1,2 \\  \left| {{a}_{t,i}\left( t\right) }\right|  \leq  {a}_{\max ,i},i = 1,2 \\  \left| {{j}_{t,i}\left( t\right) }\right|  \leq  {j}_{\max ,i},i = 1,2 \end{array}\right. \]

where \( T \) (seconds) represents the execution time,which does not need to be set in advance because the parameter \( u \) of B-spline is normalized to the interval \( \left\lbrack  {0,1}\right\rbrack  ;{Z}_{\text{energy }} \) is a term of the sum of the square root of the time integral of the squared joint accelerations to measure the energy consumption; \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) is a term of the sum of the maximum of absolute jerk of all the joints to indicate the smoothness of the trajectory; symbols \( {a}_{u,i} \) and \( {a}_{t,i} \) indicate normalized time acceleration and execution time acceleration of the joint \( i \) respectively,the same for \( {v}_{u,i},{v}_{t,i},{j}_{u,i} \) and \( {j}_{t,i} \) as well,and \( {v}_{\max ,i},{a}_{\max ,i},{j}_{\max ,i} \) indicate the maximum velocity,the maximum acceleration,and the maximum jerk of the joint \( i \) respectively. The conversion relationship between the normalized time kinematic indices and the execution time kinematic indices is as follows:

\[{v}_{t,i} = \frac{{v}_{u,i}}{T},{a}_{t,i} = \frac{{a}_{u,i}}{{T}^{2}},{j}_{t,i} = \frac{{j}_{u,i}}{{T}^{3}} \tag{19}\]

\[t = u \cdot  T,u \in  \left\lbrack  {0,1}\right\rbrack  \]

Note that the trajectory generation method in Section 3.2 is independent of the execution time. Since the B-spline curve parameter \( u \) is normalized, the trajectory's practical meaning can be obtained by specifying the execution time after generating that curve. However, the energy-jerk comprehensive optimization can be achieved a priori, regardless of the execution time. After the execution time is specified, the trajectory must satisfy the constraints of maximum velocity, acceleration, and jerk, which are not considered before specifying the execution time. Furthermore, the time-optimal objective should be taken into consideration. The whole optimization model can be divided into two submodels to be solved, which are shown in Fig. 6.

## 5. Process of solving time-energy-jerk optimization model

### 5.1. Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm

The QPSO algorithm simulates the human learning process and builds up a quantum \( \delta \) potential well model based on the aggregation of group intelligence, and then designs the control method of parameters based on the self-organization and synergy of human groups. The algorithm has few parameters, simple operation, fast convergence speed, strong optimization ability, global convergence, and a strong ability to deal with continuous nonlinear optimization problems. The QPSO algorithm used in this paper is based on quantum \( \delta \) potential well, \( 1 \rightarrow  {0.5} \) linear decreasing strategy of contraction-expansion (CE) coefficient. In this algorithm, only the number of particles and the maximum number of iterations need to be set. The symbols used in the QPSO algorithm are shown in Table 1.

In the QPSO with \( m \) individuals,the individuals called particles are in the \( D \) -dimensional quantum space,with the current position vector of particle \( i \) at the \( k \) th iteration represented as \( {X}_{i,k} = \left( {{X}_{i,k}^{1},{X}_{i,k}^{2},\ldots ,{X}_{i,k}^{D}}\right) \) . It is assumed that at the \( k \) th iteration,particle \( i \) flies with a \( \delta \) potential well centered at \( {p}_{i,k}^{j} \) on the \( j \) th dimension \( \left( {1 \leq  j \leq  D}\right) \) . The particle moves according to the following equations:

\[{X}_{i,k + 1}^{j} = {p}_{i,k}^{j} \pm  \alpha \left| {{X}_{i,k}^{j} - {C}_{k}^{j}}\right| \ln \left( \frac{1}{{u}_{i,k + 1}^{j}}\right) ,{u}_{i,k}^{j} \sim  U\left( {0,1}\right)  \tag{20}\]

\[{p}_{i,k}^{j} = r{a}_{i,k}^{j}{P}_{i,k}^{j} + \left( {1 - r{a}_{i,k}^{j}}\right) {G}_{k}^{j},r{a}_{i,k}^{j} \sim  U\left( {0,1}\right)  \tag{21}\]

for \( i = 1,2,\ldots ,m;j = 1,2,\ldots ,D \) . Vector \( {P}_{i,k} = \left( {{P}_{i,k}^{1},{P}_{i,k}^{2},\ldots ,{P}_{i,k}^{D}}\right) \) is the best previous position of particle \( i \) called personal best (pbest) position, and vector \( {G}_{k} = \left( {{G}_{k}^{1},{G}_{k}^{2},\ldots ,{G}_{k}^{D}}\right) \) is the position of the best particle among all the particles in the population and is called global best (gbest) position. Without loss of generality, the following minimization problem is considered:

Minimize \( f\left( X\right) \) ,s.t \( X \in  {\mathbb{R}}^{D} \)

where, \( f\left( X\right) \) is a fitness function,then \( {P}_{i,k} \) can be updated by

The parameters \( r{a}_{i,k}^{j} \) and \( {u}_{i,k}^{j} \) are sequences of two different random numbers distributed uniformly within(0,1),which is denoted by \( r{a}_{i,k}^{j} \) \( {u}_{i,k}^{j} \sim  U\left( {0,1}\right) .{C}_{k} = \left( {{C}_{k}^{1},{C}_{k}^{2},\ldots ,{C}_{k}^{D}}\right) \) is called mean best (mbest) position defined by the average of the pbest positions of all particles: \( {C}_{k}^{j} = \) \( \frac{1}{m}\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 1}}^{m}{P}_{i,k}^{j}\left( {1 \leq  j \leq  D}\right) \) . The parameter \( \alpha \) is called contraction-expansion (CE) coefficient which can be adjusted to balance the local and global search of the algorithm during the optimization process, and in this paper \( 1 \rightarrow  {0.5} \) linear decreasing strategy (Sun et al.,2004b; Sun et al., 2012; Yuan et al., 2018) is adopted to determine CE coefficient.

### 5.2. Mapping particles to time parameters

The \( n + 1 \) time parameters are the decision variables of the interpolation optimization model. Since the particles in the QPSO algorithm are randomly generated in \( \left( {0, + \infty }\right) \) ,it is necessary to map them to a nondecreasing sequence in the fitness function to represent the time parameters, and when the QPSO algorithm is completed, the optimal time parameters can be obtained by applying the same mapping method to the optimal particle. In addition, to improve the algorithm's operating efficiency, particles with value greater than 1 in any dimension should be penalized to narrow the algorithm's search region. The complete procedure is as follows:

Step1: Use the penalty method to filter particles with values in(0,1) for each dimension,and a particle can be expressed as \( {q}_{1},{q}_{2},\ldots ,{q}_{n} \) . Step2: Normalize them using the following formula:

\[{q}_{j}^{\prime } = \frac{{q}_{j}}{\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{j = 1}}^{n}{q}_{j}},j = 1,2,\ldots ,n \tag{22}\]

Step3: Calculate the cumulative sum for \( \left\{  {{q}_{j}^{\prime },j = 1,2,\ldots ,n}\right\} \) :

\[{q}_{j}^{ * } = \mathop{\sum }\limits_{{k = 1}}^{j}{q}_{k}^{\prime },j = 1,2,\ldots ,n \tag{23}\]

Step4: Now the \( n + 1 \) time parameters can be expressed as

\[0,{q}_{1}^{ * },{q}_{2}^{ * },\ldots ,{q}_{n - 1}^{ * },{q}_{n}^{ * },{q}_{n}^{ * } = 1 \tag{24}\]

### 5.3. Satisfaction function

A common form of the weighted method for the energy-jerk comprehensive objective is shown in Eq. (25):

\[\text{Fitness} = {c}_{1} \cdot  {Z}_{\text{energy }} + {c}_{2} \cdot  {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \tag{25}\]

where, \( {c}_{1},{c}_{2} \) are the non-negative weight coefficients that convert the two objectives into a comprehensive objective. However, it is hard to determine the appropriate values for \( {c}_{1} \) and \( {c}_{2} \) ,due to the differing orders of magnitude of the energy index and the jerk index. In this study, satisfaction function is proposed to convert various objectives into a single objective analytically, which is a preferable technique compared with the method of determining the aforementioned weight coefficients empirically.

Satisfaction function denotes the satisfaction degree of an objective, which is defined on the closed interval \( \left\lbrack  {0,1}\right\rbrack \) . Let \( {\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{jerk }} \) be the satisfaction function of \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) and \( {\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{energy }} \) be the satisfaction function (geometrically illustrated in Fig. 8) of \( {Z}_{\text{energy }} \) ,and they are formulated as

\[{\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{jerk }} = \left\{  \begin{matrix} 1,\text{ if }{\psi }_{\text{jerk }} > {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \\  \frac{{\Psi }_{\text{jerk }} - {Z}_{\text{jerk }}}{{\Psi }_{\text{jerk }} - {\psi }_{\text{jerk }}},\text{ otherwise } \\  0,\text{ if }{\Psi }_{\text{jerk }} < {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \end{matrix}\right.  \tag{26}\]

\[{\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{energy }} = \left\{  \begin{matrix} 1,\text{ if }{\psi }_{\text{energy }} > {Z}_{\text{energy }} \\  \frac{{\Psi }_{\text{energy }} - {Z}_{\text{energy }}}{{\Psi }_{\text{energy }} - {\psi }_{\text{energy }}},\text{ otherwise } \\  0,\text{ if }{\Psi }_{\text{energy }} < {Z}_{\text{energy }} \end{matrix}\right.  \tag{27}\]

Fig. 8. Statement of the satisfaction function.

<!-- Media -->

where, \( {\Psi }_{\text{jerk }} \) denotes the maximum reference value of \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }},{\Psi }_{\text{energy }} \) denotes the maximum reference value of \( {Z}_{\text{energy }},{\psi }_{\text{jerk }} \) denotes the minimum reference value of \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) and \( {\psi }_{\text{energy }} \) denotes the minimum reference value of \( {Z}_{\text{energy }} \) . Solving the single-objective optimization model enables obtaining the minimum reference value, whereas setting the maximum reference value too large can negatively affect the quality of the comprehensive optimal solution. As fitness values at the initial stages of iteration are already adequately high, it is preferable to use the formula presented below to set an appropriate maximum reference value:

\[\left\{  \begin{matrix} {\Psi }_{\text{jerk }} = {\sigma }_{1} \cdot  \max \left\{  {Z}_{\text{jerk }}\right\}   + \left( {1 - {\sigma }_{1}}\right)  \cdot  \min \left\{  {Z}_{\text{jerk }}\right\}  \\  {\Psi }_{\text{energy }} = {\sigma }_{2} \cdot  \max \left\{  {Z}_{\text{energy }}\right\}   + \left( {1 - {\sigma }_{2}}\right)  \cdot  \min \left\{  {Z}_{\text{energy }}\right\}   \end{matrix}\right.  \tag{28}\]

where, \( \max \{ Z\} \) and \( \min \{ Z\} \) refer to the maximum and the minimum fitness values of the best particles in all iterations (geometrically illustrated in Fig. 9). The factors \( {\sigma }_{1} \) and \( {\sigma }_{2} \) are defined in(0,1)to adjust the maximum reference value term. For instance,a large value of \( {\sigma }_{1} \) indicates a greater degree of satisfaction with the jerk index of the current solution. To balance the relatively large jerk index at the beginning of the iteration, \( {\sigma }_{1} \) should be set to a small value. For most cases,the value of \( \sigma \) can be set to 0.5,which would meet the requirement. The corresponding iteration diagram can be used to determine whether the initial fitness value is substantially large or not.

#### 5.4.The design of the fitness function

At the onset, the particles are randomly initialized and their corresponding satisfaction values \( {\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{energy }} \) and \( {\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{jerk }} \) are set to zero due to the poor quality of the initial solutions. It is crucial to direct the particles towards a more desirable region with low values of \( {Z}_{\text{energy }} \) and \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) to increase the satisfaction values above zero. Thus,the sum of \( {Z}_{\text{energy }} \) and \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) is selected to be the fitness function in the first stage to complete the guidance for the particles, namely:

<!-- Meanless: W. Chen et al. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107223-->

\[\text{Fitness} = {Z}_{\text{energy }} + {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \tag{29}\]

Fig. 9. The fitness values of best particles in all iterations.

<!-- Media -->

<!-- Meanless: 8-->


As the conditions \( {\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{jerk }} > 0 \) and \( {\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{energy }} > 0 \) are satisfied,then the fitness function is replaced by Eq. (30) for the rest iterative process.

\[\text{Fitness} =  - \left( {{\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{jerk }} + {\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{energy }}}\right)  \tag{30}\]

An extra minus is added since the QPSO in this study is proposed to solve the minimum value problems. The sum of the energy satisfaction value and jerk satisfaction value denotes the comprehensive satisfaction, which ranges from 0 to 2,and the percentage form is \( \frac{1}{2}\left( {{\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{jerk }} + {\widetilde{\mu }}_{\text{energy }}}\right)  \times \) 100%.

Note that there has been a change in the order of magnitude of the fitness function, and this can negatively affect the search process of many other intelligent algorithms such as GA and SA. However, in the QPSO algorithm, the fitness function magnitude serves only to rank solutions, making the difference in fitness between two solutions insignificant.

The optimal time parameters, obtained through the energy-jerk objective model, serve as inputs to the time objective model. In the latter, the optimal execution time is determined by deriving a threshold execution time from each kinematic constraint and selecting the minimum value.

### 5.5. Derivation of execution time considering kinematic constraints

Since the parameter \( u \) of B-spline is normalized to the interval \( \left\lbrack  {0,1}\right\rbrack \) , the execution time \( T \) is set to 1 when solving energy-jerk objective model. During the process of solving this model, there has been a tradeoff between the energy and jerk objectives. As a result, there are two possible approaches to incorporate the consideration of the execution time:

1. Directly consider \( T \) as the objective function and minimize it under kinematic constraints. In this way, the obtained trajectory is actually time-optimal, rather than a trade-off between time, energy, and jerk objectives, which would lead to maximizing the energy and jerk objectives. To achieve a lower energy-jerk hybrid objective, the kinematic constraints can be tightened. Combining Eq. (19), the optimal execution time \( {T}^{ * } \) can be obtained:

\[\begin{cases} {T}^{ * } = & \mathop{\max }\limits_{{k \in  \{ 1,2,3\} }}\left\{  {T}_{k,i}\right\}  \\  {T}_{1,i} = & \frac{\mathop{\max }\limits_{u}\left\{  \left| {v}_{u,i}\right| \right\}  }{{v}_{\max ,i}},{T}_{2,i} = \sqrt{\frac{\mathop{\max }\limits_{u}\left\{  \left| {a}_{u,i}\right| \right\}  }{{a}_{\max ,i}}},{T}_{3,i} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{\mathop{\max }\limits_{u}\left\{  \left| {b}_{u,i}\right| \right\}  }{{b}_{\max ,i}}} \end{cases} \tag{31}\]

2. By varying \( T \) as the independent variable while considering the kinematic constraints, the Pareto Frontier formed by execution time, energy, and jerk objectives can be calculated. Then, the appropriate execution time \( T \) can be selected from it based on the specific circumstances. This paper adopts Eq. (32) to derive the execution time and this approach allows for a trade-off between the objectives of time, energy, and jerk:

Minimize \( {s}_{1}^{2} + {s}_{2}^{2} + {s}_{3}^{2} \)

\[\text{s.t.}\left\{  \begin{array}{l} {s}_{1}\left( T\right)  = \frac{{Z}_{\text{time }}\left( T\right)  - \mathop{\min }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{time }}\left( T\right) }\right\}  }{\mathop{\max }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{time }}\left( T\right) }\right\}   - \mathop{\min }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{time }}\left( T\right) }\right\}  } \\  {s}_{2}\left( T\right)  = \frac{{Z}_{\text{censy }}\left( T\right)  - \mathop{\min }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{energy }}\left( T\right) }\right\}  }{\mathop{\max }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{energy }}\left( T\right) }\right\}   - \mathop{\min }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{energy }}\left( T\right) }\right\}  } \\  {s}_{3}\left( T\right)  = \frac{{Z}_{\text{jerk }}\left( T\right)  - \mathop{\min }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{leck }}\left( T\right) }\right\}  }{\mathop{\max }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{energy }}\left( T\right) }\right\}   - \mathop{\min }\limits_{T}\left\{  {{Z}_{\text{ser }}\left( T\right) }\right\}  } \\  \end{array}\right.  \tag{32}\]

where the minimum of \( T \) is denoted as \( {T}^{ * } \) determined by Eq. (31),and the maximum of \( T \) can be chosen as \( {10}{T}^{ * } \) . The formula is designed to identify the point in the Pareto Frontier that has the minimum normalized distance from the ideal point (see Fig. 10).

## 6. Simulation and discussion

#### 6.1.The introduction to the simulation experiments

The simulation experiments comprise three main parts.

In the first part, comparison between the classic method and the method proposed in this paper is presented. In the classic method, the time parameters are determined using the cumulative chord length parameterization approach. Contrastingly, the proposed method obtains the optimal time parameters by solving the energy-jerk optimization model using the QPSO algorithm. In this part of experiments, detailed mathematical process is displayed.

The second part presents a robustness analysis of the proposed method. The purpose of the robustness analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of the satisfaction method under varying numbers of iterations. This process involves multiple repeated calculations in order to obtain statistically expected results.

The third part provides comparisons between the approach proposed in this paper and other multi-objective optimization algorithms. Since calculating the execution time is relatively simple, the main focus lies in comparing the effects of different methods in trading off energy and jerk objectives. The effectiveness of the algorithm is indicated by the sum of satisfactions as the chosen performance metric, and the efficiency is indicated by the runtime.

### 6.2. Part I: the comparison between the classic method and the proposed method

##### 6.2.1.The classic method

In the interpolation problem of B-spline, it is necessary to determine the variables \( {\bar{u}}_{k} \) that correspond to the data points \( {\mathbf{Q}}_{k} \) being interpolated. The cumulative chord length parameterization approach is a commonly used method, and we use the phrase "classic method" to refer to this approach. In classic method,the time parameters \( {\bar{u}}_{k} \) can be determined by Eq. (33).

\[\left\{  {\begin{matrix} {\bar{u}}_{0} = 0 \\  {\bar{u}}_{k} = \frac{\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 0}}^{{k - 1}}\begin{Vmatrix}{{\mathbf{Q}}_{i + 1} - {\mathbf{Q}}_{i}}\end{Vmatrix}}{\mathop{\sum }\limits_{{i = 0}}^{{n - 1}}\begin{Vmatrix}{{\mathbf{Q}}_{i + 1} - {\mathbf{Q}}_{i}}\end{Vmatrix}},k = 1,2,\ldots ,n \end{matrix},}\right.  \tag{33}\]

Before the calculation of time parameters, the via-points in the joint space are obtained through the inverse kinematics transformation, and the results are shown in Fig. 13 and Table 4.

From Eq. (33), the time parameters can be calculated (see Table 5).

From Eq. (17) the interior knots can be calculated and thus the result of the knot vector \( U \) is as follows:

<!-- Meanless: W. Chen et al. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107223-->

<!-- Media -->

Note that the number 0.092 and 0.762 are the virtual knots to ensure zero jerk value at the start and the end points.

After the time parameters \( {\bar{u}}_{k} \) and the knot vector \( U \) are obtained,we can calculate the coefficient matrix \( A \) of the linear system of equations from Eq.(14,15). The detailed and efficient iterative algorithms for calculating basis functions and their derivatives of various orders can be found in (Piegl and Tiller, 1995). They also provide fast iterative algorithms for calculating B-splines and their derivatives of varying orders. The result of \( {A}_{{14} \times  {14}} \) is shown in Table 5 and Table 6.

The matrix is invertible so we can calculate the control points \( {\mathbf{P}}_{i} \) . The result of the control points is shown in Table 7:

Once the time parameters \( {\bar{u}}_{k} \) ,knot vector \( U \) ,and control points \( {\mathbf{P}}_{i} \) have been calculated, we can determine the quintic B-spline curve in the joint space. Using forward kinematics transformation, we can now derive the trajectory in the operating space with a total execution time of 1 s. The trajectory passes through the start point when \( u = 0 \) ,and through the end point when \( u = 1 \) . The trajectory in the operating space is shown in Fig. 14.

In the case of \( T = 1\mathrm{\;s} \) ,we have \( {Z}_{\text{energy }} = {1989}\mathrm{\;J} \) and \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} = \) \( {156750}\mathrm{{deg}}/{\mathrm{s}}^{3} \) ,and these two values will be converted to sum of satisfactions to be compared to the results obtained using the QPSO method in Section 6.2.2.

Until now, the kinematic constraints have not been considered and in the upcoming steps these constraints will be integrated to determine the execution time. In the whole simulation experiments, we employed the second approach presented in Eq. (32) to acquire the execution time. This approach facilitates a balance between the objectives of time, energy, and jerk.

From Eq. (31),we have \( {T}_{1,1} = {0.1751}\mathrm{\;s},{T}_{1,2} = {0.1782}\mathrm{\;s},{T}_{2,1} = \) \( {0.2875}\mathrm{\;s},{T}_{2,2} = {0.2966}\mathrm{\;s},{T}_{3,1} = {0.2713}\mathrm{\;s},{T}_{3,2} = {0.3084}\mathrm{\;s} \) . For example, \( {T}_{1,1} = {0.1751} \) s indicates that for joint 1 the maximum absolute velocity requires at least \( {0.1751}\mathrm{\;s} \) to ensure its corresponding constraints are satisfied. The similar idea can be applied to other cases of \( {T}_{ij},i = 1,2,3 \) , \( j = 1,2 \) . Consequently,the minimum execution time \( {T}^{ * } = {0.3084}\mathrm{\;s} \) is derived.

Varying \( T \) from \( {T}^{ * } = {0.3084}\mathrm{\;s} \) to \( {10}{T}^{ * } = {3.084}\mathrm{\;s} \) ,then the Pareto frontier of \( {Z}_{\text{time }},{Z}_{\text{energy }} \) and \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) can be obtained,which is shown in Fig. 15. Through Eq. (32), the optimal solution can be selected:

<!-- Meanless: W. Chen et al. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107223-->

\[{Z}_{\text{time }} = {0.8766}\mathrm{\;s},{Z}_{\text{energy }} = {2423}\mathrm{\;J},{Z}_{\text{jerk }} = {232724}\mathrm{{deg}}/{\mathrm{s}}^{3}\]

##### 6.2.2.The proposed method in this paper

The term "proposed method" refers to the process of obtaining the optimal time parameters by solving the energy-jerk objective optimization model, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Once the time parameters are obtained, the remaining steps are followed to generate a complete trajectory, as described in Section 6.2.1.

Now, we will provide an example to demonstrate how time parameters are randomly generated in QPSO algorithm. The randomly generated particle of which each element is limited to(0,1)is shown in Table 8, and applying the method mentioned in Section 5.2, we can obtain the time parameters.

Next, we will demonstrate the process of getting optimal time parameters. First,we solve the single-objective optimization model for \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) and \( {Z}_{\text{energy }} \) ,respectively. The number of particles is 20 and the maximum number of iterations is 200 . The iteration diagrams are shown in Fig. 16.

Here the execution time \( T \) is normalized to \( 1\mathrm{\;s} \) and we have \( \max \left\{  {Z}_{\text{energy }}\right\}   = {2574}\mathrm{\;J},\;\max \left\{  {Z}_{\text{jerk }}\right\}   = {47711}\mathrm{\;{deg}}/{\mathrm{s}}^{3},\;{\psi }_{\text{energy }} = \) \( \min \left\{  {Z}_{\text{energy }}\right\}   = {998.8}\mathrm{\;J},{\psi }_{\text{jerk }} = \min \left\{  {Z}_{\text{jerk }}\right\}   = {24521}\mathrm{\;{deg}}/{\mathrm{s}}^{3} \) . These four "max" or "min" notations are the results for the discrete data in Fig. 16. We choose to take \( {\sigma }_{1} = {\sigma }_{2} = {0.5} \) and get \( {\Psi }_{\text{energy }} = {1786}\mathrm{\;J},{\Psi }_{\text{jerk }} = \) \( {36116}\mathrm{{deg}}/{\mathrm{s}}^{3} \) from Eq. (28).

The acquisition of parameters \( {\psi }_{\text{energy }},{\psi }_{\text{jerk }},{\Psi }_{\text{energy }} \) and \( {\Psi }_{\text{jerk }} \) allows Eq.(26,27)to convert \( {Z}_{\text{energy }} \) and \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) to the sum of satisfactions when \( T = 1\mathrm{\;s} \) . However,it is not possible to directly use the sum of satisfactions as the fitness function in the QPSO algorithm. This is because during the initial iterations,the values of \( {Z}_{\text{energy }} \) and \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) are relatively large, resulting in all sum of satisfactions values being zero and indistinguishable. Consequently, it becomes impossible to select better particles from the particle swarm to gradually improve the results. To avoid such a situation,we initially choose to use \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) as the objective function to guide the improvement of the particle swarm, and when the sum of satisfactions reaches a value greater than 0 , we then switch the subsequent iterations' objective function to the sum of satisfactions. The iterative process of solving the energy-jerk objective optimization model based on the QPSO algorithm is shown in Fig. 17. The optimal time parameters are shown in Table 9.

The sum of satisfactions is used in this paper as a metric to assess the overall level of satisfaction with both the energy objective and the jerk objective. In Part III, it will be employed to evaluate the results of other multi-objective optimization algorithms.

Now we have obtained time parameters for 4 cases: the classic method, optimizing only energy, optimizing only jerk, and comprehensive optimization of energy and jerk. Based on these parameters, we can calculate the satisfaction degree of each case with respect to the energy and jerk objectives when \( T = 1\mathrm{\;s} \) ,as shown in Table 10 . The proposed method shows significant improvements (The average satisfaction degree increases from \( 0\% \) to \( {1.856}/2 = {92.8}\% \) .) compared to the non-optimized classic method in both the energy and jerk objectives. The energy-jerk optimization also yields superior result compared to only optimizing either the energy or jerk objective. After energy-jerk optimization, vibrational effects are mitigated and an efficient, energy-saving trajectory is achieved.

Considering the kinematic constraints, the minimum execution time \( {T}^{ * } = {0.1939}\mathrm{\;s} \) . The variation of the minimum execution time means that the maximum productivity of the fast pick-and-place operation increases from 97 to 155 picks per minute. From the Pareto frontier shown in Fig. 18, we have the optimal result:

\[{Z}_{\text{time }} = {0.551}\mathrm{\;s},{Z}_{\text{energy }} = {2718}\mathrm{\;J},{Z}_{\text{jerk }} = {146449}\mathrm{{deg}}/{\mathrm{s}}^{3}\]

The ultimate kinematic indices of the joints of the two methods are shown in Table 11. These maximum absolute kinematic indices have a significant margin from their maximum limits, ensuring safety during the operation of the manipulator.

The comparison of the trajectories in the operating space are shown in Fig. 19 and the model simulation of the manipulator is shown in Fig. 20. Fig. 21 displays the motion profiles of the joints of the two methods.

Fig. 22 shows the motion profiles of the end effector. From the motion profiles, it is evident that the initial and final moments of the manipulator have a velocity, acceleration, and jerk of zero. This characteristic results in a low tracking error and reduced residual vibration. The low vibration along the trajectory protects the mechanism and enables the high-speed manipulator to complete tasks requiring low vibration in the operating space.

The kinematic indices of the end effector of the two methods are shown in Table 12.

### 6.3. Part II: the robustness analysis of the proposed method

In the experiments in Part I, the number of particles is set as 20 and the number of iterations is set as 200 when employing the QPSO algorithm, regardless of solving the single-objective model or the energy-jerk comprehensive model. In Table 10, the satisfaction obtained for jerk when only optimizing the energy objective is 0 . This indicates that the value of \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) obtained is quite large,leading to dissatisfaction with this result. Although this occurrence is not always guaranteed, its presence suggests that a significant \( {Z}_{\text{jerk }} \) value is not a rare event. Furthermore, the sum-of-satisfactions results for energy-jerk optimization and sole jerk optimization are relatively close (1.856 for the former and 1.824 for the latter). The effectiveness and impact of the comprehensive optimization method are still unknown and require further analysis of its robustness.

In this study, we focus on investigating the impact of different numbers of iterations on the model results. For a specific particle number and number of iterations, we repeated the computations of the proposed method described in Part I for 50 times. Each computation consists of three steps: (1) Solving the sole jerk optimization; (2) solving the sole energy optimization; (3) solving the energy-jerk comprehensive model. We record the satisfaction results of each computation and calculate the mean sum-of-satisfaction results for the three cases over the 50 computations. Based on these averages, we analyze the frequency at which the comprehensive model achieved the best sum-of-satisfactions result.

The consequences presented in Fig. 23 reveal that, for a fixed particle number, the frequency at which the comprehensive model achieves the highest sum-of-satisfactions outcome in these three cases increases as the number of iterations of the QPSO algorithm increases from 30 to 350. When the particle number is 20 , when the number of iterations approximately exceeds 100 , the frequency consistently surpasses around 0.7 and the rate of increase slows down. This suggests that at this point, the performance of the comprehensive model in comparison to the other two scenarios yields a significant advantage. For a particle number of 8 , when the number of iterations approximately exceeds 150 , the frequency consistently surpasses around 0.6 and the rate of increase slows down. At this stage, the comprehensive model demonstrates a clear advantage over the other two scenarios. It is evident that when the particle number is 20 , the satisfaction method outperforms the case with a particle number of 8 .

The usage of frequency is employed in the previous analysis to determine the advantages of the comprehensive model. Now, by observing the sum-of-satisfactions results, it can be concluded that when the number of iterations is low, the mean satisfaction degree of the sole energy optimization is similar to that of the comprehensive model. However, after this point, the mean satisfaction degree of the sole energy optimization rapidly decreases. On the other hand, the mean satisfaction degree of the sole jerk optimization consistently exhibits a certain gap in comparison to the comprehensive model.

The robustness analysis demonstrates that utilizing the concept of satisfaction in the energy-jerk optimization produces superior outcomes in comparison to the single-objective models when the particle number is fixed at 20 and the number of iterations is set to 200 .

### 6.4. Part III: comparisons between the proposed method and other multi- objective algorithms

In this paper,the normalized property of the B-spline parameter \( u \) allows for the separate computation of the execution time. Therefore, the comparison of different multi-objective algorithms will be conducted through the comprehensive optimization of the energy and jerk objectives. In this study, the sum of the satisfaction degrees is used as an indicator to assess the performance of the comprehensive optimization results. Even though the satisfaction concept was not utilized in the solving process, such as in the classic method mentioned in Section

## 6.2.1, it can still be evaluated using satisfaction degree.

There are generally two common implementation methods for multi-objective optimization: Pareto frontier based methods and weighted methods. In this part, the PSO algorithm (Mezura-Montes and Coello Coello, 2011; Pedersen, 2010) based on weighted method, the GA algorithm based on weighted method and the NSGA-II algorithm (Deb, 2001) based on Pareto frontier are employed to optimize energy-jerk comprehensive model and evaluated using sum of the satisfactions. These three optimization algorithms are built-in functions in MATLAB.

In the PSO algorithm, the number of particles is set to 20, while the other parameters are kept at their default values. As for the GA and NSGA-II algorithms, the population size is set to 50 , with the remaining parameters also kept at their default values. The fitness function employed by the PSO algorithm is given by Eq. (25), and the weight coefficients, \( {c}_{1} \) and \( {c}_{2} \) ,are determined based on experimental experience,with \( {c}_{1} = {10} \) and \( {c}_{2} = 1 \) . The GA algorithm is used for comparison with the PSO algorithm,where \( {c}_{1} \) and \( {c}_{2} \) are both set to 1 . Similarly to Eq. (32), the NSGA-II algorithm selects the optimal individuals from the Pareto frontier to form the population.

For each algorithm, it is repeated 100 times and the mean and standard deviation of the satisfaction degree, as well as the mean and standard deviation of the runtime, are recorded. The results are displayed in Fig. 24.

The results demonstrate that the proposed method in this paper, represented by QPSO, possesses the highest mean satisfaction degree and the lowest mean runtime. This implies that not only does this algorithm achieve good optimization results, but it is also highly efficient. The PSO algorithm with weighted parameters comes in second place overall. The NSGA-II algorithm exhibits a larger mean runtime and a greater standard deviation, indicating its instability. The GA algorithm does not show any advantages in terms of optimization effectiveness or algorithm efficiency.

Although the results of the PSO and QPSO algorithms are similar, the former requires the numerical experimentation to determine the weight coefficients, and inappropriate coefficients can significantly affect the results. In contrast, the proposed satisfaction-based method in this paper avoids the difficulty of weight coefficient selection. Moreover, compared to the Pareto frontier-based approaches, our method has lower computational complexity.

## 7. Conclusion and future research

Industrial robot manipulator trajectory planning aims to achieve high efficiency, low energy consumption, and reduced vibration for better performance and protection of the machinery. The main focus of this study is a multi-node off-line trajectory planning problem, which proposes a time-energy-jerk comprehensive optimization model to generate improved trajectories. The model uses kinematic parameters to represent energy consumption and vibration, while considering limitations on the maximum absolute angular velocity, acceleration, and jerk. A satisfaction function transforms the energy consumption and jerk indices into a comprehensive objective, which is then optimized using the QPSO algorithm. Then the optimal execution time is determined based on the kinematic constraints. Simulation results on a 2-DOF parallel manipulator demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an efficient and energy-saving trajectory with reduced vibration. By applying the comprehensive trajectory generated by the proposed method, instead of using the classic method, the maximum productivity of the fast pick-and-place operation increases from 97 to 155 picks per minute. This improvement is achieved while using less energy and reducing vibration. The results of the robustness analysis indicate that the proposed method in this paper achieves stable outcomes. Furthermore, a comparison with other multi-objective optimization algorithms demonstrates that our algorithm not only provides better optimization performance but also requires less computational effort.

The main contributions of this research are restated as follows.

1. The quintic B-spline-based trajectory generation approach is enhanced by including two virtual via-points that enable the incorporation of jerk boundary constraints into the model, resulting in reduced residual vibration.

2. A time-energy-jerk optimization model is created, which is divided into two submodels considering the normalized parameter of the B-spline. The energy-jerk comprehensive optimization is solved without kinematic constraints. Then, execution time is optimized with the limitation on the absolute joint velocity, acceleration, and jerk.

3. The satisfaction function is proposed to convert the multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective model, accounting for the challenges caused by differing orders of magnitude of objectives. The QPSO algorithm is an apt choice for the whole model.

The following is an outline of our future research plans. Firstly, the present study focuses on a scenario where the load is relatively light in comparison to the carrying capacity of the manipulator and further research will aim to increase the load for simulation and experimental comparison. Secondly, further research includes conducting real-world experiments. It would be more convincing if the model could be validated with real-world experiments. This would help determine the proposed method's practicality and reliability in real-world scenarios.
