Smoothing the discretized toolpaths generated by CAM systems is vital for CNC options in improving the quality of machined surfaces. One discretized toolpath from CAM is commonly represented in the form of a series of linear and arc segments. The linear segment smoothing method has been extensively investigated. However, for linear and arc joint segments,which are in the form of G01 and G02/03 mixing modes,efficient smoothing strategies are still lacking. In this study, an integrated toolpath smoothing method based on motion overlapping strategy is proposed to improve the continuities of the mixture of G01 and G02/03 codes. To satisfy the requests of the kinematic limitations and high efficiency, heuristic algorithms are used to seek optimum kinematic parameters. Meanwhile, we also introduce a variable jerk-limited feedrate profile in the motion overlapping strategy to further reduce the machining time. Simulations on various toolpaths are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the classical FIR and B-spline methods. The machining experiment executed on a 3-axis machine tool with a real-time CNC system also demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method.

## 1. Introduction

Numerous parts for aerospace or die-and-mold industries contain complex sculptured geometries, which are usually designed in CAD/ CAM systems by using smooth parametric curves or surfaces, such as NURBS [1]. For most CAM software, the curve is discrete into a series of small segments as the form of G01 and G02/03 commands, given user-defined precision constraints with just C0 continuous guaranteed at the junction of blocks in most situations [2]. However, in the high-speed machining process, such non-smooth trajectories may cause non-smooth cutting motions which can cause several negative influences such as the discontinuity of the acceleration, triggering the oscillations of the tool, or deteriorating the accuracy and surface quality [3]. Thus, a straightforward approach is to improve the geometric smoothness of the G code commands by replacing unsmooth corners with high-degree continuous curves within user-defined tolerance locally or globally in CNC.

For local methods, the general idea is to replace the sharp corners within two adjacent segments with some smoothing blending curves. Various local smoothing algorithms have been proposed by introducing B-splines, BÃ©zier curve, PH curves and clothoid splines [4-13]. However, if the tool path is composed of a high density of short segments, it is possible to smooth these segments by using global methods [14]. For these methods, the initial toolpath could be represented by an entire smoothing curve such as NURBS [15], polynomial spline [16] or B-spline [17-19].

In the stage of feedrate scheduling, the feedrate profiles of the mixture of lines and curves or a parametric curve should be optimized without violating the axis kinematic limitations. The most common model of feedrate profile is the jerk limited acceleration profile (JLAP) proposed by Erkorkmaz K et al. [20]. JLAP constructs trapezoidal acceleration transitions with piecewise constant jerk segments, which can effectively avoid vibrations and balance smoothness and efficiency. Other feedrate profile models \( \left\lbrack  {{11},{21},{22}}\right\rbrack \) have been studied to achieve higher order continuous motions by using analytic functions to describe the rule of feedrate changing.

The separation of geometric smoothing and feedrate scheduling modules causes the implicit relationship between curve parameters and time parameters, leading to unavoidable feedrate fluctuation. In addition, it is quite time consuming to generate a time-optimal feedrate profile on a parametric curve. Thus, numerous one-step methods have been proposed. Such solutions can be roughly summarized into three categories: kinematic-based methods [23-27], FIR (Finite Impulse Response) methods [28-30] and motion overlapping methods [31-33]. Tajima and Sencer presented a symmetrical kinematic corner smoothing method with the consideration of jerk limitation [26] and smoothed short and dense linear paths by adjusting corner error [27]. A local asymmetrical kinematic corner smoothing method was proposed in [24] to fully exploit the kinematic performance of each axis which cannot be achieved in symmetrical methods. Besides, FIR is popular in feedrate scheduling assignments since it is easy to apply in NC model [28]. Some smoothing methods \( \left\lbrack  {{29},{30}}\right\rbrack \) based on FIR aimed at smoothing adjacent discontinuous in feedrate profiles. Another direct approach is motion overlapping [31-33] which starts the cutting motion for the next segment before the current stage of cutting motion is completely stopped. He et al. [31] overlapped the motions of adjacent segments to achieve smoothing transition for G01 VG02 commands by only considering the linear feedrate profile. Zhang et al. [32] proposed a motion overlapping method with the limitation of acceleration and jerk of each axis and extended their method to the 5-axis situation [33].

It should be noted that most of aforementioned researches concern about linear toolpaths smoothing while ignoring the existence of arcs segments, which are also common in part designing and toolpath generation. For example, sharp corners need to be rounded by arcs segments which is called fillet. Actually, the short linear segments could be replaced by an arc segment, as shown in Fig. 1. In this sense, the size of G code could be reduced. For two-steps solutions, clothoid spline [34] and B-spline [35] are considered to smooth toolpaths both containing G01 and G02\\03 commands. For clothid spline,the gap of curvature of circles and lines will be transitioned smoothly, and interpolation will also be easily conducted [34]. B-spline method replaced G01, G02\\03 tool-paths with an entire B-spline within the given tolerance [35]. Whereas, these methods still separated geometry smoothing and feedrate scheduling modules. For one-step solution, since the direction and magnitude of feedrate, acceleration, and jerk in circle segment are variable, direct designing of transition for feedrate profile is difficult. Although Tajima et al. used FIR to generate smooth feedrate profile and overlapped adjacent feedrate profiles to smooth the trajectory [36], there lacks detailed discussion about kinematic characteristics in overlapping duration.

This paper proposed a one-step smoothing method for G01 and G02 \\G03 mixed commands. The kinematic principles on the circular segment are firstly detailed. With the consideration of four typical situations, the corner can be transitioned smoothly by overlapping two motions of adjacent segments within the corner error tolerance and kinematic limitations. Then, heuristic algorithms are used to search optimum kinematic parameters. In order to further improve the performance of efficiency of methods in [32,33] which adopted a conservative value of jerk to generate feedrate profile, a variable jerk-limited feedrate profile is introduced in this paper. The rest of this article is organized in detail as follows. In Section 2, the detailed steps of our method are presented consisting feedrate scheduling method for circle segment, corner transition modelling for lines and arcs mixed toolpaths, and optimal parameters solving algorithms. Then, the variable jerk-limited feedrate profile with different jerks is introduced in Section 3. In Section 4, we present an illustrative example to further explain our method, Numerical simulations and cutting experiments are conducted in Section 5, respectively. Finally, we conclude the article in Section 6.

## 2. Proposed trajectory smoothing method

In this section, a particular feedrate scheduling process based on Jerk-limited acceleration model is firstly executed to obtain the time-optimal feedrate profile for circular segment with the kinematic limitations. Subsequently, the motions of two adjacent segments are overlapped to transit the corner smoothly. All the possible overlapping situations are considered and further converted into several time-optimal optimization problems. Through these procedures, the kinematic parameter jerk of each segment, which can both guarantee the minimize motion time and kinematic limitations, could be determined.

### 2.1. Feedrate scheduling for circle segment based on Jerk-limited acceleration profile

In this section, we study the laws for displacement, feedrates and jerk of each axis for circular segments. The proposed model assumes that circular motion starts and ends with zero feedrate and acceleration as shown in Fig. 2. Then, this model will be used to determine the maximum acceleration and jerk in overlapping duration.

#### 2.1.1. Modelling the feed motion for circular toolpath

Based on the Pessoles et al. [37], the tangential feedrate profile is designed by Jerk-limited acceleration profile. Then, the position functions can be established as Eq. (1):

\[\mathrm{X}\left( \mathrm{t}\right)  = \operatorname{Rcos}\left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right)  + {X}_{o} \tag{1}\]

<!-- Meanless: 243-->

\[\mathrm{Y}\left( \mathrm{t}\right)  = \operatorname{Rsin}\left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right)  + {Y}_{o}\]

where \( R,l\left( t\right) \) and \( \alpha \) are the radius of circular segment,the arc length calculated by JLAP model and the initial angle phase,respectively. \( {X}_{o} \) and \( {Y}_{o} \) are the coordinates of center of the circular arc.

Then, feedrate can be solved by differencing Eq. (1):

\[{v}_{x}\left( t\right)  =  - v\left( t\right) \sin \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right)  \tag{2}\]

\[{v}_{y}\left( t\right)  = v\left( t\right) \cos \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right) \]

Differentiating Eq. (2) yields obtaining the acceleration

\[{a}_{x} =  - A\left( t\right) \sin \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right)  - \frac{v{\left( t\right) }^{2}}{R}\cos \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right)  \tag{3}\]

\[{a}_{y} = A\left( t\right) \cos \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right)  - \frac{v{\left( t\right) }^{2}}{R}\sin \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right) \]

Differentiating Eq. (3), we can obtain the jerk equation

\[{j}_{x} =  - j\left( t\right) \sin \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right)  - {3A}\left( t\right) v\left( t\right) \frac{1}{R}\cos \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right)  + \frac{v{\left( t\right) }^{3}}{{R}^{2}}\sin \left( {\frac{l\left( t\right) }{R} + \alpha }\right) \]

Due to the acceleration and jerk of each axis, the resultant acceleration and jerk can be expressed as Eq. (4):

\[{A}_{r} = \sqrt{{a}_{x}^{2} + {a}_{y}^{2}} = \sqrt{A{\left( t\right) }^{2} + \frac{v{\left( t\right) }^{4}}{{R}^{2}}} \tag{5}\]

\[{j}_{r} = \sqrt{{j}_{x}^{2} + {j}_{y}^{2}} = \sqrt{{\left( j\left( t\right)  - \frac{v{\left( t\right) }^{3}}{{R}^{2}}\right) }^{2} + {9A}{\left( t\right) }^{2}v{\left( t\right) }^{2}}\]

In relative papers, the restrictions of acceleration and jerk are considered on either X- and Y-axis directions, or tangential and normal directions. Since the decomposition directions are perpendicular to each other. Eq. (5) satisfy

\[\left| {a}_{x}\right| ,\left| {a}_{y}\right| ,\left| {a}_{t}\right| ,\left| {a}_{n}\right|  \leq  {A}_{r} \tag{6}\]

\[\left| {j}_{x}\right| ,\left| {j}_{y}\right| ,\left| {j}_{t}\right| ,\left| {j}_{n}\right|  \leq  {j}_{r}\]

where \( {a}_{t},{a}_{n},{j}_{t} \) and \( {j}_{n} \) are tangential acceleration,normal acceleration, tangential jerk and normal jerk, respectively.

According to Eq. (5), if the resultant acceleration and jerk are constrained, regardless of whether it is in the axis direction or in the tangential and normal directions, the acceleration and jerk are both constrained. Hence, the resultant acceleration and jerk should be under the limitation of acceleration \( {A}_{m} \) and jerk \( {J}_{m} \) .

\[\max {A}_{r} \leq  {A}_{m} \tag{7}\]

\[{max}{j}_{r} \leq  {J}_{m}\]

#### 2.1.2. Analyzing the maximum value of acceleration and jerk

In order to constrain acceleration and jerk, the maximum values of them should be solved. For convenience, the squares of acceleration and jerk are considered. Since the jerk profile in JLAP is piecewise and symmetrical, there are four cases should be discussed.

Case 1

This case is the first phase in JLAP with the duration t1, and the value of jerk is a constant value J. Then, Eq. (7) can be rewritten as

\[{A}_{r,1}^{2} = {J}^{2}{t}^{2} + \frac{{J}^{4}{t}^{8}}{{16}{R}^{2}}\]

\[{j}_{r,1}^{2} = {\left( J - \frac{{J}^{3}{t}^{6}}{8{R}^{2}}\right) }^{2} + \frac{9}{4}{J}^{4}{t}^{6} \tag{8}\]

\[\mathrm{t} \in  \left\lbrack  {0,{t}_{1}}\right\rbrack  \]

Obviously, \( {A}_{r,1}^{2} \) and \( {j}_{r,1}^{2} \) are both increasing with time parameter \( \mathrm{t} \) .

Case 2

This case is the second phase in JLAP which is a uniformly accelerated motion. Thus, Eq. (7) can be rewritten as

\[{A}_{r,2}^{2} = {J}^{2}{t}_{1}^{2} + \frac{{\left( {v}_{1} + J{t}_{1}t\right) }^{4}}{{R}^{2}}\]

\[{j}_{r,2}^{2} = \frac{{\left( {v}_{1} + J{t}_{1}t\right) }^{6}}{{R}^{4}} + 9{J}^{2}{t}_{1}^{2}{\left( {v}_{1} + J{t}_{1}t\right) }^{2} \tag{9}\]

\[\mathrm{t} \in  \left\lbrack  {0,{t}_{2}}\right\rbrack  \]

<!-- Meanless: 245-->




<!-- Meanless: H. Li et al. Journal of Manufacturing Processes 95 (2023) 242-265-->

In this case, \( {A}_{r,2}^{2} \) and \( {j}_{r,2}^{2} \) are also increasing with time. Case 3

<!-- Media -->

Case 3 is the third phase in JLAP. In this case,the value of jerk is \( - J \) , and the duration is \( {t}_{3} \) . Since the resultant acceleration and jerk are only dependent on the motion time, the inverse motion of the third phase can be used to analyze when the feedrate profile has been given in advance. Hence, Eq. (7) has the expression as

\[{A}_{r,3}^{2} = {\left( -J\right) }^{2}{t}^{2} + \frac{{\left( {v}_{m} - {0.5}J{t}^{2}\right) }^{4}}{{R}^{2}}\]

\[{j}_{r,3}^{2} = {\left( -J - \frac{{\left( {v}_{m} - {0.5}J{t}^{2}\right) }^{3}}{{R}^{2}}\right) }^{2} + 9{\left( -J\right) }^{2}{t}^{2}{\left( {v}_{m} - {0.5}J{t}^{2}\right) }^{2} \tag{10}\]

\[\mathrm{t} \in  \left\lbrack  {0,{t}_{3}}\right\rbrack  \]

where \( {v}_{m} \) is the maximum velocity which can be reached. In order to determine the monotony of Eq. (10), zero points could be obtained by solving Eq. (11)

<!-- Meanless: 246-->




<!-- Meanless: H. Li et al. Journal of Manufacturing Processes 95 (2023) 242-265-->

\[\mathrm{J}{t}^{2} = 2{v}_{m} - 2\sqrt[3]{{0.5J}{R}^{2}} \tag{11}\]

\[\left( {-\mathrm{J} - \frac{{\left( {v}_{m} - {0.5}J{t}^{2}\right) }^{3}}{{R}^{2}}}\right) {\left( {v}_{m} - {0.5}J{t}^{2}\right) }^{2}t + {3Jt}{\left( {v}_{m} - {0.5}J{t}^{2}\right) }^{2}\]

<!-- Media -->

Case 4 is a uniform circular motion of the duration t4. \( {A}_{r,4}^{2} \) and \( {j}_{r,4}^{2} \) are both constant values.

\[{A}_{r,4}^{2} = \frac{{v}_{m}^{4}}{{R}^{2}} \tag{12}\]

\[{j}_{r,4}^{2} = \frac{{v}_{m}^{6}}{{R}^{4}}\]

For case 1, 2, and 4, it is effortless to get the maximum acceleration and jerk. For case 3, solving the root of polynomial Eq. (11) is inevitable. Nevertheless, there are many mature algorithms to solve this equation. Note that, since the duration time is usually short in high-speeding machining, it can be considered that there is at most one extreme point in \( \left\lbrack  {0,{t}_{3}}\right\rbrack \) .

In Eqs. (8), (9), (10), and (11), there are some parameters magnitudes of maximum velocity \( {v}_{m} \) and jerk that have an effect on the maximum acceleration and jerk. Then,decreasing \( {v}_{m} \) and \( \mathrm{J} \) can reduce the maximum values of acceleration and jerk.

#### 2.1.3. Time-optimal feedrate scheduling for circular path

To achieve higher efficiency, an optimal formulation is established with the limitation of maximum acceleration and jerk. Because of the symmetric of JLAP, the objective function about machining time satisfies Eq. (13)

\[4{t}_{1} + 2{t}_{2} + {t}_{4} = \frac{A}{J} + \frac{{v}_{m}}{A} + \frac{L}{{v}_{m}} \tag{13}\]

where A, J and L are reachable maximum tangential acceleration, tangential jerk and required displacement. It is noted that the reachable maximum tangential acceleration is dependent on \( \mathrm{J} \) and \( \mathrm{L} \) .

Considering the limitations of acceleration and jerk, restricted conditions are obtained

\[\max \left( {\max \left( {A}_{r,i}\right) }\right) ,\mathrm{i} = 1,2,3,4 \leq  {A}_{m} \tag{14}\]

\[\max \left( {\max \left( {j}_{r,i}\right) }\right) ,\mathrm{i} = 1,2,3,4 \leq  {J}_{m}\]

For this optimal problem, it is difficult to calculate the partial derivatives of maximum acceleration and jerk with respect to A, J, and L for lack of analytical expressions. Therefore, heuristic approach may have better performance and be specifically discussed in following section.

### 2.2. Corner transition for lines and arcs mixed toolpaths

Based on the feedrate scheduling methods for linear [6] and circular toolpaths, the feedrate profile of each segment can be obtained. In the conventional situation, the motion of latter segment starts until the former one is over. However, in the motion overlapping method, the latter motion has started when the former one do not stop. Thus, a time period \( \left\lbrack  {{t}_{s},{t}_{e}}\right\rbrack \) is defined as corner smoothing time \( {t}_{d} \) in which the feedrate of two segments is overlapped. Since desired trajectory consists of linear and circular segments, there are four configurations to be smoothed, that is line to line, line to circle, circle to line, and circle and circle. To preferably realize feedrate blending, it should be noted that corner smoothing time is no longer than the duration of decelerating phase of first segment or the duration of accelerating phase of following segment. Importantly, because overlap of motions of two adjacent segments would cause the deviation from original toolpaths and variations in feedrate values, the corner error and kinematic characteristics should be constrained.

#### 2.2.1. Corner error control

As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the original corner of two linear segments is replaced with smooth trajectory which starts from \( {P}_{a} \) and ends at \( {P}_{b} \) . Since two segments move synchronously, the corner error exists. We demonstrate the corner smoothing trajectories for line-to-arc, arc-to-line and arc-to-arc situations in Fig. 3 (b), (c) and (d). In order to control the deviation, a definition of corner error should be given. Usually, the distance between joint point and middle point of smoothing curve is regarded as the corner error. However, it is reasonable only when the smoothing trajectory is symmetric about corner bisector for linear segments. When the trajectory is asymmetric, or circular arcs exist, corner error is difficult to define. Normally, Hausdorff distance is used to measure this deviation but it is difficult to obtain, for Hausdorff distance needs to compute the distance from original toolpaths to modified trajectory and distance from modified trajectory to original toolpaths [38].

In this paper, a modified definition of corner error, which is applicable to all trace connection types and asymmetric situation, is proposed based on the idea of Hausdorff distance. As shown in Fig. 3, considering a point \( \mathrm{P} \) on the modified trajectory,the distance \( {d}_{1} \) and \( {d}_{2} \) from point \( \mathrm{P} \) to corresponding two adjacent segments \( {L}_{1} \) and \( {L}_{2} \) can be calculated by Eqs. (15) and (16)

Distance from point to line:

\[\mathrm{d} = \sqrt{{\begin{Vmatrix}\overrightarrow{{p}_{2}p}\end{Vmatrix}}^{2} - {\left( \frac{\left\langle  \overrightarrow{{p}_{2}{p}_{i}},\overrightarrow{{p}_{2}p}\right\rangle  }{\begin{Vmatrix}\overrightarrow{{p}_{2}{p}_{i}}\end{Vmatrix}}\right) }^{2}},i = 1\text{ or }3 \tag{15}\]

Thus,the deviation on the point \( \mathrm{P} \) is defined as Eq. (17)

\[{d}_{p} = \min \left( {{d}_{1},{d}_{2}}\right)  \tag{17}\]

Then,the point \( {P}_{cor} \) ,which have the maximum deviation,will be obtained

\[{p}_{\text{cor }} = \operatorname{argmax}\left( {d}_{p}\right)  \tag{18}\]

Finally,the corner error \( \mathrm{e} \) is defined as the length of \( \overrightarrow{{P}_{b}{P}_{cor}} \) .

\[\mathrm{e} = \begin{Vmatrix}\overrightarrow{{P}_{b}{P}_{cor}}\end{Vmatrix} \tag{19}\]

Since calculating the corner error is difficult by definition, it is perfect if all connecting types have analytic expressions of corner error to obtain the duration time of overlapping phase. Unfortunately, only line-to-line type have analytic expression deduced from kinematic equation. Obviously,point \( {P}_{\text{cor }} \) will locate on the corner bisector. Assuming that the feedrate profile of first segment is denoted as \( \left( {{J}_{1},{t}_{1},{t}_{2},{t}_{4}}\right) \) ,and the feedrate profile of second segment is \( \left( {{J}_{2},{T}_{1},{T}_{2},{T}_{4}}\right) \) . In Fig. 3 (a),according to corner error e,the moving length on segment \( 1{l}_{1} \) and segment \( 2{l}_{2} \) is obtained.

\[{l}_{1}\overrightarrow{{n}_{1}} + {l}_{2}\overrightarrow{{n}_{2}} = e\overrightarrow{{n}_{b}} \tag{20}\]

where \( \overrightarrow{{n}_{1}},\overrightarrow{{n}_{2}} \) and \( \overrightarrow{{n}_{b}} \) are unit direction vector of first segment,second segment and corner bisector,respectively. When \( {l}_{1} \) and \( {l}_{2} \) are calculated, the overlapping time \( {t}_{d} \) can be obtained based on jerk-limited feedrate profile. If there are arcs, iterative strategy will be applied to compute corresponding moving lengths for two segments. Firstly, an initial overlapping time \( {t}_{d} \) can be selected. Then,according to the synchro-nicity of motions during overlapping, the corner error can be computed. The overlapping time should be modified until the corner error is close to the given threshold. Note that to escape inserted overlap, the overlapping time should not exceed \( \min \left( {2{t}_{1} + {t}_{2},2{T}_{1} + {T}_{2}}\right) \) .

#### 2.2.2. Kinematic characteristics control in overlapping phase

In order to design algorithm for acceleration and jerk controlling, the kinematic analysis for overlapping phase is necessary. The simplest type is linear segments which have been particularly discussed in [33]. Since the acceleration and jerk profiles are nonlinear functions, kinematic analysis for these types including circular arcs is challengeable.

Firstly, for the line-to-arc connection type, the displacement, fee-drate,acceleration and jerk on first segment are denoted as \( {di}{s}_{1},{f}_{1},{A}_{1} \) and \( {J}_{1} \) ,respectively. When the subscript becomes 2,these symbols indicate the corresponding characteristics on the second segment. Then, the displacement, feedrate, acceleration and jerk functions in overlapping phase can be written as Eqs. (21), (22), (23) and (24)

\[{X}_{\text{over }} = {di}{s}_{1}\cos {\theta }_{1} + \operatorname{Rcos}\left( {\frac{{di}{s}_{2}}{R} + \alpha }\right)  + {X}_{O} \tag{21}\]

\[{Y}_{\text{over }} = {di}{s}_{1}\sin {\theta }_{1} + R\sin \left( {\frac{{di}{s}_{2}}{R} + \alpha }\right)  + {Y}_{O}\]

\[{v}_{x,\text{ over }} = {f}_{1}\cos {\theta }_{1} - {f}_{2}\sin \left( {\frac{{di}{s}_{2}}{R} + \alpha }\right)  \tag{22}\]

\[{v}_{y,\text{ over }} = {f}_{1}\sin {\theta }_{1} + {f}_{2}\cos \left( {\frac{{di}{s}_{2}}{R} + \alpha }\right) \]

\[{a}_{x,\text{ over }} = {A}_{1}\cos {\theta }_{1} - {A}_{2}\sin \left( {\frac{{di}{s}_{2}}{R} + \alpha }\right)  - \frac{{f}_{2}^{2}}{R}\cos \left( {\frac{{di}{s}_{2}}{R} + \alpha }\right)  \tag{23}\]

\[{a}_{y,\text{ over }} = {A}_{1}\sin {\theta }_{1} + {A}_{2}\cos \left( {\frac{{di}{s}_{2}}{R} + \alpha }\right)  - \frac{{f}_{2}^{2}}{R}\sin \left( {\frac{{di}{s}_{2}}{R} + \alpha }\right) \]

In order to obtain the time-optimal \( {J}_{1},{f}_{2} \) and \( {J}_{2} \) ,the objective function can be constructed as the sum of the motion times of two segments combining with Eq. (13):

\[\min \left( {\frac{{A}_{1m}}{{J}_{1}} + \frac{{f}_{1}}{{A}_{1m}} + \frac{{L}_{1}}{{f}_{1}} + \frac{{A}_{2m}}{{J}_{2}} + \frac{{f}_{2}}{{A}_{2m}} + \frac{{L}_{2}}{{f}_{2}}}\right)  \tag{25}\]

Meanwhile, the resultant acceleration and jerk profiles for linear, circular and overlapping phases should be limited.

In Eq. (25), these expressions consist of two parts: linear parts and circular parts. Linear parts may go through the 5, 6 and 7 phases, and the circular parts may go through the 1,2 and 3 phases. Due to the existence of nonlinear terms, it is difficult to obtained maximum value of acceleration and jerk by using the analytical approaches. Besides, using Gauss iteration directly without deliberate initial point may increase the iteration times and be unstable. For the resultant acceleration, the general trend is that the two ends are higher, and the middle is lower. Since the acceleration value of second segment at beginning is small, the variation tendency of resultant acceleration at start is similar as first segment, and the same is true for the end. Combining the discussion in previous section, acceleration will increase first and then decrease. For the jerk resultant jerk, the jerk profile either increases or decreases from linear segment. Fig. 4 presents an example composed by a linear segment

\( \overrightarrow{{P}_{i}{P}_{i + 1}} \) and \( {P}_{i + 1}{P}_{i + 2} \) ,where \( {Q}_{s} \) and \( {Q}_{e} \) are the start point and end point of overlapping motion. The values of resultant acceleration are higher on the front and back segments, and the maximum resultant jerk arise near the circular segment. Due to these properties, the maximum acceleration and jerk can be found by two steps. Firstly, since two feedrate profiles are piecewise defined, the overlapping motion is also piecewise function as shown in Fig. 4 so that the values at all interval points could be calculated. Then, the maximum acceleration and jerk can be found by using Gauss iteration in the section with maximum value at interval points. It is noted that the initial point is interval point which have maximum value. In fact, the initial point chosen using strategy mentioned above is often the optimal point.

When the maximum acceleration or jerk exceeds the limitations, the following strategies will be applied to adjust the feedrate profiles.

### 1.For acceleration:

If \( \max \left( {a}_{\text{over }}\right)  \geq  {A}_{m} \) ,and the corresponding relevant time \( {t}_{a,\max } \geq  {0.5}{t}_{d} \) ,adjusting the feedrate profile for circular segment.

If \( \max \left( {a}_{\text{over }}\right)  \geq  {A}_{m} \) ,and the corresponding relevant time \( {t}_{a,\max } < {0.5}{t}_{d} \) ,adjusting the feedrate profile for linear segment.

If \( \max \left( {a}_{\text{over }}\right)  \leq  {A}_{m} \) ,and the corresponding relevant time \( {t}_{a,\max } \geq  {0.5}{t}_{d} \) ,adjusting the feedrate profile for linear segment to increase acceleration.

If \( \max \left( {a}_{\text{over }}\right)  \leq  {A}_{m} \) ,and the corresponding relevant time \( {t}_{a,\max } < {0.5}{t}_{d} \) ,adjusting the feedrate profile for circular segment to increase acceleration.

2. For jerk:

If \( \max \left( {j}_{\text{over }}\right)  \geq  {J}_{m} \) ,and the corresponding relevant time \( {t}_{j,\max } \geq  {0.5}{t}_{d} \) ,adjusting the feedrate profile for circular segment.

If \( \max \left( {j}_{\text{over }}\right)  \geq  {J}_{m} \) ,and the corresponding relevant time \( {t}_{j,\max } < {0.5}{t}_{d} \) ,adjusting the feedrate profile for linear segment.

If \( \max \left( {j}_{\text{over }}\right) \left\langle  {J}_{m}\right. \) ,and the corresponding relevant time \( {t}_{j,\max } \geq  {0.5}{t}_{d} \) , adjusting the feedrate profile for circular segment to increase jerk.

If \( \max \left( {j}_{\text{over }}\right) \left\langle  {J}_{m}\right. \) ,and the corresponding relevant time \( {t}_{j,\max } < {0.5}{t}_{d} \) , adjusting the feedrate profile for linear segment to increase jerk.

Then, for arc-to-line type, the same strategies can be used. Finally, for arc-to-arc type, the displacement, feedrate, acceleration and jerk functions in overlapping phase also can be written as Eqs. (26), (27), (28) and (29). Parameters with subscript 1 belong to the first segment, and subscript 2 represents the parameters in the second segment.

\[{X}_{\text{over }} = {R}_{1}\cos \left( {\frac{{\operatorname{dis}}_{1}}{{R}_{1}} + {\alpha }_{1}}\right)  + {R}_{2}\cos \left( {\frac{{\operatorname{dis}}_{2}}{{R}_{2}} + {\alpha }_{2}}\right)  + {X}_{O1} + {X}_{O2} \tag{26}\]

The time-optimal objective function can be written in the same way as Eq. (30)

\[\min \left( {\frac{{A}_{1m}}{{J}_{1}} + \frac{{f}_{1}}{{A}_{1m}} + \frac{{L}_{1}}{{f}_{1}} + \frac{{A}_{2m}}{{J}_{2}} + \frac{{f}_{2}}{{A}_{2m}} + \frac{{L}_{2}}{{f}_{2}}}\right)  \tag{30}\]

In Fig. 5, considering the kinematic limitations, the maximum values of acceleration and jerk can be obtained using the similar approach as shown in Fig. 4. To achieve higher efficiency, the ability of acceleration and deceleration should be fulfilled. As the above discussions, the profiles of acceleration and jerk have similar pattern which is the values at points on both sides are higher. Hence, the adjusting strategies are similar with what is used for acceleration in line-to-arc type.

#### 2.3.The optimization process

Although the objective functions and constraints have been obtained in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the lack of analytic relationships between constraints and parameters make it difficult to using optimum algorithms based on derivative. Hence, heuristic methods should be applied to search the time-optimal solutions.

#### 2.3.1. Solutions of time-optimal circular feedrate scheduling

Before toolpaths smoothing, time-optimal feedrate profiles for circular segments should be obtained. Just like what have been presented in Section 2.1, the feedrate profile can be modified by adjusting the maximum reachable velocity \( {v}_{m} \) and tangential jerk \( {j}_{t} \) . Generally,when \( {v}_{m} \) is small,the motion time will be inevitably enlarged. Otherwise, tangential jerk should be limited that also decreases the machining efficiency. Therefore,there will be an optimal value of \( {v}_{m} \) with the shortest machining time. Following steps are used to search \( {v}_{m} \) and \( {j}_{t} \) . Input: initial maximum reachable velocity \( {v}_{0} \) ,jerk limitation \( {J}_{m} \) , acceleration limitation \( {A}_{m} \) ,feedrate disturbance \( \Delta \mathrm{v} \) Output: maximum reachable velocity \( {v}_{m} \) and tangential jerk \( {j}_{m} \) Step 1: Let \( {v}_{m} = {v}_{0},{v}_{m}^{\prime } = {v}_{0} + {\Delta v},{v}_{m}^{\prime } = {v}_{0} - {\Delta v} \) the corresponding time-optimal tangential jerks \( {j}_{m},{j}_{m}^{\prime } \) and \( {j}_{m}^{\prime } \) can be calculated with the total motion time \( {t}_{\text{total }},{t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime } \) and \( {t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime \prime } \) using binary search method. Step 2: Judging the sequence of \( {t}_{\text{total }},{t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime } \) and \( {t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime \prime } \) :

If \( {t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime } < {t}_{\text{total }} < {t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime \prime },{v}_{m} = {v}_{m}^{\prime } \) ;

Else if \( {t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime \prime } < {t}_{\text{total }} \leq  {t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime },{v}_{m} = {v}_{m}^{\prime \prime } \) ;

Else \( {t}_{\text{total }} \leq  {t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime \prime } \) and \( {t}_{\text{total }} \leq  {t}_{\text{total }}^{\prime },\Delta \mathrm{v} = {0.5\Delta }\mathrm{v} \)

The above steps are repeated until feedrate disturbance \( \Delta \mathrm{v} \) is less than the given value.

#### 2.3.2. Solutions of time-optimal overlapping motion for overlapping motions

In Section 2.2.2, some adjusting strategies are proposed and used to obtain time-optimal feedrate profiles when the jerks \( {J}_{1} \) and \( {J}_{2} \) are given in advance. For instance, considering the line-to-arc type with prescribed tangential jerks of two segment, if the resultant jerk limitation is exceeded, the maximum reachable feedrate should be updated by binary search method until the constraint is satisfied. For arc-to-arc type, with the strategy mentioned above, the maximum reachable feedrates of two segments are updated. It is notice that the proposed strategies are aimed to search the maximum feedrates which have shorter motion time as a result the final feedrate profiles are time-optimal. Furthermore, the tangential jerks of two segments should be adjusted to realize shortest motion time.

In this paper, a pattern search method, which prefers to search a direction with a decrease of the objective function, is adopted. The searching algorithm is given as follow.

Input: Initial tangential jerks \( {n}_{0} = \left( {{J}_{1,0},{J}_{2,0}}\right) \) ,Jerk limitation \( {J}_{m} \) , Acceleration limitation \( {A}_{m} \) ,Feedrate limitation \( {v}_{m} \) ,Jerk disturbance \( \Delta \mathrm{J} \) and Minimum allowable jerk disturbance \( {J}_{b} \) Output: Tangential jerks \( {J}_{1,m} \) and \( {J}_{2,m} \) . Step 1 Calculating the motion time \( {t}_{0} \) of \( {n}_{0} \) . Step 2 Let \( {n}_{1} = \left( {{J}_{1,0} + {\Delta J},{J}_{2,0}}\right) \) and \( {n}_{2} = \left( {{J}_{1,0} - {\Delta J},{J}_{2,0}}\right) \) If \( \Delta \mathrm{J} > {J}_{b} \) : goto Step 3; Else: End the algorithm and return \( {J}_{1,m} = {J}_{1,0},{J}_{2,m} = {J}_{2,0} \) ; Step 3 Calculating the motion time \( {t}_{1} \) and \( {t}_{2} \) of \( {n}_{1} \) and \( {n}_{2} \)

If \( {t}_{1} < {t}_{0} : {J}_{1,0} = {J}_{1,0} + {\Delta J},{t}_{0} = {t}_{1} \) and flag \( = 0 \) ;

Else if \( {t}_{2} < {t}_{0} : {J}_{1,0} = {J}_{1,0} - {\Delta J},{t}_{0} = {t}_{2} \) and flag \( = 0 \) ;

Else: \( {J}_{1,0} = {J}_{1,0},{t}_{0} = {t}_{0} \) and flag \( 1 = 1 \) ;

To guarantee that pattern method can find the real minimum point, the surface constructed by tangential jerks \( {J}_{1} \) and \( {J}_{2} \) of two segments and corresponding motion time \( {t}_{m} \) is best unimodal. The general shape of the surface can be obtained by roughly estimation. For line-to-arc type, when \( {J}_{1} \) become large,or \( {J}_{2} \) is larger,the maximum reachable feedrate would be more severely limited which results the longer total motion time for circular segment. Otherwise,when \( {J}_{1} \) is small,the total motion time would be enlarged in linear segment. If \( {J}_{2} \) is small,the total motion time will be also enlarged. For arc-to-arc type,whether \( {J}_{1} \) is large or small,or whether \( {J}_{2} \) become large or small,the overall motion time will increase. Hence, the whole surface can be regarded as convex. Usually, point \( \left( {{0.5}{J}_{m},{0.5}{J}_{m}}\right) \) are selected as initial point.

## 3. Variable jerk-limited feedrate profile with different jerks

In above sections,the solution consisting of two jerks \( {J}_{1} \) and \( {J}_{2} \) corresponding to first and next segments have been obtained. For instance,in Fig. 6,the tangential jerk \( {J}^{\prime } \) for \( \overrightarrow{{P}_{2}{P}_{3}} \) can be deduced from the corner \( \angle {P}_{1}{P}_{2}{P}_{3} \) . However,another tangential jerk \( {J}^{\prime } \) will be obtained considering the corner \( \angle {P}_{2}{P}_{3}{P}_{4} \) . In order to satisfy the kinematic limitations,smaller value in \( \left( {{J}^{\prime },{J}^{\prime }}\right) \) will be selected as tangential jerk for \( \overrightarrow{{P}_{2}{P}_{3}} \) [29]. But,the total motion time will be enlarged by using the smaller value. Thus, a variable jerk-limited feedrate model is proposed. In Fig. 6, the absolute value of jerk in phase 1 and 3 is different with the value in phase 5 and 7 so that the efficiency will be improved.

There is no harm to assume that \( {J}^{\prime } > {J}^{\prime } \) so that such feedrate profile can be constructed through the following process.

Firstly,the feedrate profile with \( {J}^{\prime } \) is constructed to determine the durations of phase 5,6 and 7 and maximum reachable feedrate \( {v}_{m} \) . Then, the durations of phase 1,2 and 3 can be determined with \( {J}^{\prime } \) and \( {v}_{m} \) . Finally, the duration of phase 4 will be calculated by Eq. (31)

\[{t}_{4}^{\prime } = \frac{L - {S}_{acc} - {S}_{dec}}{{v}_{m}} \tag{31}\]

where \( {S}_{acc} \) and \( {S}_{dec} \) are displacements of acceleration and deceleration, respectively, and can be calculated by Eq. (32)

\[{S}_{acc} = {0.5}{v}_{m}\left( {2{t}_{1} + {t}_{2}}\right)  \tag{32}\]

Furthermore, the durations of all phase could be computed by Eq. (33) if \( {v}_{m} \) has been known.

\[{t}_{2} = {t}_{6} = \left\{  \begin{matrix} 0,\text{ if }\sqrt{\frac{{v}_{m}}{{J}^{\prime \prime }}} > \frac{{A}_{m}}{{J}^{\prime \prime }} \\  \frac{{v}_{m}}{{A}_{m}} - \frac{{A}_{m}}{{J}^{\prime \prime }},\text{ otherwise } \end{matrix}\right. \]

\[{t}_{1} = {t}_{5} = \left\{  \begin{array}{l} \frac{{A}_{m}}{{J}^{\prime \prime }},\text{ if }\sqrt{\frac{{v}_{m}}{{J}^{\prime \prime }}} > \frac{{A}_{m}}{{J}^{\prime \prime }} \\  \sqrt{\frac{{v}_{m}}{{J}^{\prime \prime }}},\text{ otherwise } \end{array}\right.  \tag{33}\]

\[{t}_{4} = \frac{L - {S}_{acc} - {S}_{dec}}{{v}_{m}}\]

Specifically,when the tangential jerk \( {J}^{\prime } \) and motion displacement \( \mathrm{L} \) have been given, \( {v}_{m} \) should be determined in first step. \( {v}_{m} \) would be updated through binary search until the terminal condition Eq. (34) is satisfied.

Then,durations of phase 1,2 and 3 could be updated by replacing \( {J}^{\prime } \) with \( {J}^{\prime } \) . Then,acceleration displacement \( {S}_{acc} \) would be calculated again. The duration of phase 4 also be calculated by Eq. (31). Because the acceleration time has been reduced in modified feedrate profile shown as the red curve in Fig. 6, the performance in machining efficiency has been improved.

## 4. Illustrative example

In order to explain our method clearly, a simple example which is a single transition constructed by a line and arc is presented, as shown in Fig. 7. The allowable maximum velocity \( \mathrm{F} \) ,acceleration \( {A}_{m} \) ,and jerk \( {J}_{m} \) are given as \( {40}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/\mathrm{s},{400}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{2} \) ,and \( {4000}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{3} \) . Proposed method and FIR method are implemented to smooth this simple tool path. Then, the profiles of total motion time, acceleration, and jerk are compared in this section.

### 4.1. Computing parameters

In proposed method, we expect to find the optimum kinematic parameters: two jerks J1 and J2 for two segments which lead to shortest motion time. Note that, due to the introduce of variable jerk-limited feedrate profile, J1 is the second jerk for line segment and J2 is the first jerk for arc segment. With the specific jerks J1 and J2, the correspond optimal motion time can be found by using the adjusting rules mentioned above so that the tripe \( \left( {{J}_{1},{J}_{2}\text{,time}}\right) \) can be presented in three-dimensional space as a point.

For a single transition or corner, the motion time is defined as the deceleration time of previous segment adds the acceleration time of the latter segment.

Obviously, by altering the value of J1 and J2, a surface is constructed as presented in Fig. 8. Our task is to search the minimum point or approximate minimum point on this surface. For convenience of observation, the part of this surface where the motion time exceed the given value such as \( {0.45}\mathrm{\;s} \) is truncated by a plane.

In the Fig. 9 which is the contour map of the surface, the black point is the solution which is gotten by our method. It is almost the optimal result and locates at (3250,1458) which means the values of J1 and J2 are \( {3250}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{3} \) and \( {1458}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{3} \) ,respectively.

To implement the FIR method [36], time delays T1 and T2 of filters must be determined. However, in the literature [36], authors did not give a detailed approach to select these parameters. Despite of the consideration of residual vibration,we must find suitable \( {T}_{1} \) and \( {T}_{2} \) with the kinematic limits.

Firstly, the tangential acceleration and jerk satisfy the following equation:

\[\left\{  \begin{matrix} A = \frac{F}{T1} \leq  {A}_{m} \\  J = \frac{F}{T1T2} \leq  {J}_{m} \end{matrix}\right.  \tag{35}\]

From Eq. (35), an original point can be obtained:

\[{T}_{1} = \frac{F}{{A}_{m}} \tag{36}\]

\[{T}_{2} = \frac{{A}_{m}}{{J}_{m}}\]

Subsequently, defining a searching region:

\[U = \left\{  {\left( {{T}_{1},{T}_{2}}\right)  \mid  {T}_{1} \in  \left\lbrack  {\frac{F}{{A}_{m}},2\frac{F}{{A}_{m}}}\right\rbrack  ,{T}_{2} \in  \left\lbrack  {\frac{{A}_{m}}{{J}_{m}},2\frac{{A}_{m}}{{J}_{m}}}\right\rbrack  }\right\}   \tag{37}\]

For each point in the region \( \mathrm{U} \) ,one can compute the total motion time, maximum axial acceleration, and maximum axial jerk. Then, three surfaces can be obtained as shown in Fig. 10.

Contour map Fig. 11 more intuitively depicts the tendency of motion time, axial acceleration, and jerk. Then, it is convenient and acceptable to choose the values of \( {T}_{1} \) and \( {T}_{2} \) as \( {0.12}\mathrm{\;s} \) and \( {0.11}\mathrm{\;s} \) ,respectively.

### 4.2. Simulation results

The resulted trajectories of proposed method and FIR method are presented together in the Fig. 12. From this figure, both of two methods can successfully smooth the tool path. For FIR method, due to the filters, there are deviations between resulted trajectory and circular tool path.

Consequently, profiles of axial feedrate, acceleration, and jerk are shown in Figs. 13 and 14. It is obviously that FIR method results much longer motion time. Main reason of this phenomenon is the limit of deviation at circular tool path. To control the deviation within the tolerance, the allowable feedrate on circular segment should be reduced to a small value which significantly prolongs motion time. In this example,the allowable feedrate is reduced from \( {40}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/\mathrm{s} \) to \( {2.23}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/\mathrm{s} \) . For axial acceleration limits, the maximum axial accelerations for two method is only a half of the given limit that means acceleration constraint is not crucial. The axial jerk profiles generated by two methods have several parts reach the boundaries. It should be noted that the jerk for circular segment has been reduced by solving optimal function Eq. (13) before solving the optimal problem Eq. (25) and updated by \( {1500}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{3} \) .

Focusing on the feedrate profile for each segment generated by proposed method, the whole segment can be divided into two parts. One is near the corner, the other is far away from the corner. Because, in the overlapping method, only the motion around corner should be modified, the motion far away from corner can still keep maximum jerk so that machining efficiency would be improved. For example, as displayed in Fig. 14,the jerk J1 of linear segment should be decreased to \( {3258}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{3} \) from \( {4000}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{3} \) with the kinematic constraints. While it is enough to only reduce the jerk of motion phase around the corner. Thus, in the front part of motion,jerk is still \( {4000}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{3} \) .

In a conclusion, our method expects to search optimal kinematic parameters for each corner or transition by a heuristic algorithm and directly generates machining motion profile in time domain. Finally, interpolation points can be computed by sampling at equal time interval.

## 5. Simulations and experiment results

The proposed method is verified by executing simulations on several testing tool paths and the results are compared with typical methods such as: FIR [36], B-spline [7] and motion overlapping method (MOM) [33]. For FIR method [36], each segment is convolved with two finite impulse filters with time delays: \( {T}_{1} \) and \( {T}_{2} \) . Then,motions of adjacent segments would be overlapped in a certain time range \( {t}_{d} \) which can be computed according to time delays and corner errors. B-spline method [7] is a local smoothing method which replaces the corner by a B-spline curve with modified curvature. For motion overlapping method [33], at each corner, an optimization procedure is executed to seek optimal kinematic parameters for adjacent segments. Besides, an actual cutting experiment is also conducted.

We perform the simulation on two kinds of testing toolpaths. The first one is tool paths containing only linear segments. The second one is tool paths containing both linear and circular segments. In order to calculate the interpolation points, interpolation method mentioned in [6] is used for B-spline method [7], and the sampling period is appointed as \( {T}_{s} \) . To display the difference between resulting trajectories and original toolpaths, the contour error of each interpolation point, which is defined as the minimum distance between this point to all segments, is calculated. All relative algorithms are developed and implemented on VS Code by Python 3.

### 5.1. Simulation results of linear segments

In this part, a testing toolpath with a snowflake shape is applied. The snowflake-shaped toolpath designed in UGNX includes 126 linear segments. The contour errors, feedrate, acceleration and jerk profiles have been shown in Figs. 16 and 17. Smoothed trajectories, which are smoothed, and original toolpath are presented in Fig. 15. All the simulation results such as maximum feedrate, acceleration and jerk of each motion axis, maximum contour error and cycle time, are shown in Table 2. For FIR method the time delays of filters are determined as \( {T}_{1} = \) \( {0.14}\mathrm{\;s},{T}_{2} = {0.14}\mathrm{\;s} \) by the same approach mentioned in Section 4.1

<!-- Media -->

As depicted in Figs. 15 and 16, the tested toolpath has been successfully smoothed by all the methods within the given tolerance of corner error. Whereas, the resulted trajectory of FIR method has the largest contour errors. Our proposed method has the least cycle time \( {30.95}\mathrm{\;s} \) compared with the other methods. The feedrate,acceleration and jerk profiles of each axis are presented in Fig. 17. Although the axis feedrate and the axis acceleration can all be constrained within the limits, but the axis jerks in B-spline method break the given limits. This simulation supports that the proposed method can successfully regulate these kinematic characteristics for linear segments.

### 5.2. Simulation results of line and arc mixed toolpaths

For line and arc mixed testing toolpaths, an anchor-shaped and a butterfly-shaped toolpath is introduced. The adopted parameters are presented in Table 1. To validate our method, the axis feedrates, the axis accelerations and the axis jerks are computed. Meanwhile, only FIR method, which needs two finite impulse response functions with time delay, is tested for comparison because neither B-spline method [7] nor motion overlapping [33] method can handle these mixed toolpaths. All results are shown in Figs. 18-23 and Tables 3 and 4.

The anchor-shaped toolpath is depicted in Fig. 18. In this toolpath, there are 12 linear segments and 4 circular segments with four connecting types mentioned above: line-to-line, line-to-arc, arc-to-line and arc-to-arc. The resulting trajectory of FIR method has is represented by red dotted line. Two critical parameters \( {T}_{1} = {0.15s} \) and \( {T}_{2} = {0.14s} \) are determined according to the steps presented above. Then, all segments are filtered by two finite impulse responses with time delays \( {T}_{1} \) and \( {T}_{2} \) . To transit these corners smoothly, the feedrate profiles of adjacent segments are overlapped. In proposed method, feedrate profile for each segment are established by using the adjusting strategies and feedrate model mentioned in Section 2. Fig. 20 depicting the profiles of kinematic characteristics confirms that kinematic limits are almost obeyed excluding the maximum Y-axis jerk in FIR method which is about \( {4380}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{\mathrm{s}}^{3} \) . Moreover,as shown in Fig. 19,FIR method has larger contour errors, particularly in the circular segments, which exceed the corner error limit. It is noted that FIR method needs to decrease the deviations in circular segments by reducing the command feedrates which will induce the lower machining efficiency. Especially in the case where the circular segment radian is larger, this phenomenon becomes more obvious. Hence, the cycle time is approximately reduced by 20.55 \( \% \) using proposed method.

##### 5.2.1.For butterfly-shaped toolpath

In order to verify the performance of proposed method on the complicated toolpath, a butterfly-shaped toolpath generated by UGNX is used. This tool path includes 212 linear segments and 10 circular segments which are marked as \( {C}_{0},{C}_{1}\ldots \) ,and \( {C}_{9} \) in Fig. 21. In butterfly-shaped toolpath, circular segments have smaller radian which means larger feedrates are allowable when FIR method is applied. Time delays \( {T}_{1} = {0.14}\mathrm{\;s} \) and \( {T}_{2} = {0.14}\mathrm{\;s} \) are determined in the similar way. In Fig. 22, red line represents the smoothing trajectory generated by FIR method, and the resulting trajectory of proposed method is represented as green line. All kinematic profiles are displayed in Fig. 24. It can be seen that feedrate, acceleration and jerk are all limited by kinematic limits expect for X-axis jerk of FIR method which slightly exceeds the. Although the command feedrates for circular segments is larger, the cycle time of FIR method is still \( {0.6}\% \) longer than proposed one. Meanwhile,proposed method has smaller contour errors.

### 5.3. Experiment and results

Realistic cutting experiment of the butterfly-shaped toolpath revealed is conducted based on the GSK-25im CNC system and 3-axis cutting platform DMC \( {600}\mathrm{H} \) as depicted which are provided by Guangzhou CNC Equipment Co., LTD depicted in Figs. 25 and 16. To validate the applicability and performance in real-time CNC system, interpolation points are firstly calculated by using the proposed method. Subsequently, position commands are transmitted to servo drivers through GSK-25im CNC system. Eventually, cutting motion is carried out on the aluminum block by 3-axis machine tool.

In our experiment, all feed axes are driven by GR 3000 series servo motors. According to the capabilities of servo motors, the interpolation period,maximum feedrate,acceleration and jerk are set to be \( 1\mathrm{{ms}} \) , \( {50}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/\mathrm{s},{1500}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{2} \) and \( {30000}\mathrm{\;{mm}}/{s}^{3} \) ,respectively.

Fig. 26 depicts the machining result. Comparisons between feedback axis feedrate and commanded feedrate are shown in Fig. 27 (a) and (b). It can be concluded that the proposed method has well tracking performs in real-time CNC system.

## 6. Conclusion

In this article, a local one-step G-code tool path smoothing method with the motion overlapping algorithm, which takes the corner error and axis kinematic constraints into consideration, is presented.

1. In order to cope with smoothing mixture of G01 and G02/03 codes, some strategies are originally proposed to seek optimal kinematic parameters for single circular segment to establish optimal feedrate profile.

2. Consequently, these kinematic parameters would be further adjusted by using proposed method in Section 2.3.

3. Compared with the primary motion overlapping algorithm, jerk-limited feedrate model has been modified with two different jerk values in proposed method. As a result, higher efficiency can be achieved.

4. With the consideration of kinematic performance, the resultant fee-drate, acceleration and jerk are constricted in admissible ranges so that the kinematic characters, regardless of axial or tangential or radius, are limited.

In the comparisons of FIR and B-spline methods, the proposed method shows a better performance with efficiency. Simulations and experiment validate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed method for smoothing mixture segments of G01 and G02/03 codes. In future work, our method will be extended to 5-axis machining tool.
